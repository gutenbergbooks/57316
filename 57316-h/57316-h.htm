<h2 id="FOREWORD">FOREWORD</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">West Point</span> played a great part in the gaining
of American independence. It was
strongly fortified as the key of the Hudson, and as
long as it was held by the patriots of the Revolution
the New England colonies could not be cut off from
the others and conquered one at a time.</p>

<p>The lack of educated officers was greatly felt by
the Generals of the Revolution, and this lack was
but feebly supplied by trained officers from abroad.</p>

<p>It was mainly through the foresight and patriotism
of Washington, Hamilton, and Knox that the
Military Academy at West Point was founded,
and their memory is still enshrined there.</p>

<p>The Academy had its inception in very small
beginnings, first by the assignment of students to
an Engineer regiment until the organic act of 1802
created an Academy with ten cadets. A firm
establishment was not made, however, until the
detail of Colonel Sylvanus Thayer in command in
1817, who laid down the fundamental principles
which govern the Academy to this day.</p>

<p>The early graduates of the Academy suffered
much from the jealousy of the old veterans of the
Revolution who had no use for the educated soldier.
These graduates were too few to make themselves
felt in the War of 1812, and it was not until
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
General Winfield Scott eulogized their services
in the Mexican War that they began to be appreciated
by the nation.</p>

<p>Their services in the Civil War were inestimable
and are known to all who read history. After the
Spanish-American War of 1898, the then Secretary
of War, Mr. Elihu Root, reported that the services
of the graduates of the Military Academy in that
war alone had far more than repaid the cost of the
Academy since its foundation in 1802.</p>

<p>For many years the Military Academy was what
its name implies, an Academy, but it has expanded
from time to time until it is a military university,
giving instruction for all branches of the service
except the Medical Corps, and securing for each
graduate a broad foundation which enables him
to specialize in any direction by means of the
various special schools for each branch. The glory
of West Point, however, is in the West Point
character, now well known in every civilized country
in the world, with its reputation for fidelity,
efficiency, discipline, and general uprightness.
The standing army of the United States has
always been too small for the tasks that have
been laid upon it, and at every crisis it has had to
train large forces of citizen soldiers summoned
from civil life for the emergency. These citizen-soldiers,
as well as the Regular Army itself, rely
upon the scientific education and high character
of the West Point graduate to keep the art of war
abreast, if not a little ahead, of the times, and for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span>
the initiative and informing leaven to permeate the
mass and to cause the firm progress of discipline
and uprightness throughout the whole.</p>

<p>Shortly after the Mexican War a verse was
added to the old West Point song of Benny
Havens:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Their [graduates] blood has watered western plains<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And northern wilds of snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has dyed deep red the Everglades,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And walls of Mexico.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Since that time they have shed it copiously in
Cuba, China, and the Philippines, and they are
now about to take their places with comrades
from civil life fighting for liberty and democracy
on the battlefields of France.</p>

<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">This</span> book is intended to give, aside from a brief
historical sketch of West Point, something
of the feelings of the cadet from the moment that
he reports for duty until he graduates four years
later. Perhaps some of my fellow West Pointers
will disagree with me in regard to my interpretation
of their feelings, but what I have written
thereon is drawn from my own experience and
from many conversations with cadets of to-day.
The customs, traditions, methods of training of the
Academy are, I believe, unique, and they make an
unforgettable impression upon the cadet. Especially
does he become imbued with an almost indefinable
influence that we of the Academy call the
Spirit of West Point, and in the pages that follow
I have tried to seize and translate into words this
spirit of the institution. I have greatly enjoyed
writing these pages about West Point, a subject
very dear to my heart, and I offer this book to the
public in the hope that my fellow countrymen may
become better acquainted with the aims and ideals
of their National Military Academy.</p>

<p>It gives me the greatest pleasure to acknowledge
here my appreciation and thanks to Lieutenant
Colonel L. H. Holt, U. S. A., Professor of English
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span>
and History U. S. M. A., not only for his helpful
suggestions and criticisms, but for his encouragement
and unselfish interest in the preparation
of this book.</p>

<p>I also wish to acknowledge the courtesy of the
Reverend Herbert Shipman of New York, formerly
Chaplain at the Military Academy, in allowing me
to use his poem <i>The Corps</i>, with which I close the
volume.</p>

<p>Since this book has gone to press, Colonel John
Biddle, the Superintendent, has been promoted to
the grade of Brigadier-General and relieved from
the command of West Point. He has been succeeded
by Colonel Samuel E. Tillman, Retired,
who until 1910 was the Professor of Chemistry
and Electricity at the Military Academy. Colonel
Tillman perhaps more than any officer in the Army
is better qualified for this important position. He
is a graduate of West Point, to whose advancement
he has devoted most of his life and he has made
an exhaustive study of its needs. His appointment
by the President seems to be particularly
felicitous for he possesses a most intimate knowledge
of the Military Academy. All West Pointers
rejoice that West Point is in such good hands.</p>

<h2 class="xx-large">WEST POINT</h2>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />

<span class="large">IN THE DAYS OF THE REVOLUTION</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Despite</span> the successful attempts of the architect
to give to the magnificent new buildings
at West Point a mediæval character, there
is nothing about them to suggest a feeling of
oldness, a feeling that they are linked with the
history of the place. Not until one wanders
among the ruins of old Fort Putnam, explores
the crumbling works of the chain of Redoubts on
the surrounding hills, or rambles over the débris
of Fort Constitution on Constitution Island,
does he feel the flavor of age, the romance of
West Point of the past. It is only then that the
imagination races back over the years to the days
of the Revolution where it pauses to rebuild the
stirring events that filled the daily lives of our
ancestors in their desperate struggle for our
independence. Looking backward through the
vista of more than a century the most commonplace
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
happenings seem powdered with the golden
dust of romance. Interwoven with each event
are the names of the men who helped to make
possible these free United States: Washington,
Hamilton, Knox; and of him who was almost
successful in thwarting their efforts, the traitor
Benedict Arnold.</p>

<p>As far back as the time of the French and
Indian Wars both the Americans and British
recognized the great value of the control of the
Hudson River. It would seem, therefore, that
when the Revolution broke out both sides would
take every means to seize and fortify the most
strategic points along its banks. Strange to say,
the Americans were as indifferent about its control
as the British, so that the Revolution was in
progress for three years before West Point, the
natural key to the river’s defense, was fortified.</p>

<p>During the Revolution the British were operating
from Manhattan on the south and Canada
on the north as bases. Had they controlled the
Hudson, they could have separated the eastern
from the middle colonies, which division would
have prevented the patriots from military combination
and from interchanging the necessary
commodities for both sections.</p>

<p>Immediately after the battles of Concord and
Lexington, the Congress of New York, acting
upon a suggestion from the Continental Congress,
sent a commission to the Highlands to select “the
most proper place for erecting one or more fortifications.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
Constitution Island, and the sites
where Forts Montgomery and Clinton<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> were
afterwards built, were chosen. Nothing much
was accomplished, however, in the way of fortifications
despite the appointment of another
commission that recommended the absolute
necessity for works at West Point opposite
Constitution Island.</p>

<p>Washington, accompanied by General Heath,
finally sailed up the river in 1776, and General
Heath tells us that “a glance at West Point
without going on shore evinced that this post
was not to be neglected.” Meanwhile the Revolution
dragged on into its third year, 1778, but
still no fortifications at West Point. Due to
Washington’s persistence, work was begun there
early in January, 1778. General Parsons with
his brigade arrived at West Point on the 20th of
January and began the erection of defenses.
The weather was extremely cold, provisions were
scarce, the men inadequately clothed, and the
troops poorly supplied with the proper implements
to carry on their labor. Altogether, a very depressing
and discouraging situation confronted
Parsons’s men as they debouched upon the Plain
and surveyed their surroundings. If any thought
could have given them courage it must have
been the reflection that at least they were somewhat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
better off than their comrades in arms down
at Valley Forge, who, despite their wretched
condition, were bravely keeping alive the patriotic
fires of the Revolution.</p>

<p>What a contrast was that first sight of West
Point to Parsons’s troops to that offered today!
Instead of the beautiful level parade ground
surrounded by fine granite buildings they found
an undulating plain covered by a growth of yellow
pines ten or fifteen feet high, without house or
habitation. The only point of similarity was the
snow, waist high. After strenuous efforts to get
logs from the neighboring hills, a few rude huts
were hastily thrown together, and then, at the
end of three weeks, the soldiers fell to work with
a will, building Fort Clinton under the direction
of a splendid young French engineer by the name
of de la Radière. The cold was most intense,
but the men went up the river, cut the timber
for the Fort, and assembled it so that when the
river was open, it might be floated down to the
Point. Their hard daily toil was not relieved by
any diversions in the evening, for West Point
was a veritable wilderness. General Parsons,
in writing to Colonel Wadsworth, said of West
Point, “to a contemplative mind that delights in
a lonely retreat from the world ’tis as beautiful
as Sharon, but affords to the man who loves the
society of the world a prospect nearly allied to
the shades of death.... News arrives here by
accident only.” The poor soldiers had to repair
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
night after night to their little log huts and get
what pleasure they could from one another’s society.</p>

<p>The rigors of the winter and the hardships to
which the Revolutionary soldiers were accustomed
overwhelmed the delicate constitution of the
brilliant young de la Radière. Unhappily, he
contracted a severe cold that culminated in consumption
from which he died the following mid-summer.
Another European, attracted by the
justice of the Revolutionary cause, succeeded
de la Radière. Thaddeus Kosciusko, a Pole of
education and culture, joined Parsons’s officers,
with whom he became a great favorite, not only
on account of his engineering ability but by reason
of his charming manners, soft and conciliating,
and by the elevation of his mind. One officer
wrote that he took much pleasure in accompanying
Kosciusko with his theodolite measuring the
heights of the surrounding mountains.</p>

<p>Today Kosciusko’s name is more familiar to
West Pointers than de la Radière’s, for an enchanting
little garden, a tiny retreat hanging on
to the cliff near the river, bears his name, and a
monument, in the northeast corner of the Plain
near Port Clinton that he helped build, commemorates
his devotion to the Revolutionary cause.</p>

<p>Kosciusko’s presence and energy put new life
into the work of construction. Shortly afterwards,
when orders came from Washington to
expedite the completion of all of the forts, Parsons
and Kosciusko, under the direction of Colonel
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
Rufus Putnam, immediately commenced excavations
for Fort Putnam.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> The men now daily
trudged up the small hill back of the Plain and
began making clearings for the fort’s foundation.
It was hard laborious work, extremely fatiguing,
and, to add to the men’s discomfiture, they were
greatly annoyed by large rattlesnakes with which
the hill top seemed to swarm.</p>

<p>While the land defenses were being so well prepared,
steps were taken to prevent enemy ships from
passing up the Hudson. The topography of West
Point and the adjacent country lent itself most
admirably to the plan of obstructing the river.</p>

<p>The Hudson, as it comes down from Newburgh
a straight course of nine miles, strikes West
Point, where it is deflected eastward for a quarter
of a mile, flowing between Constitution Island
and the steep cliffs of the Point before again
turning south. Any British sailing vessel coming
up the river from New York would, upon
rounding Gee’s Point, lose a great deal of its speed
on account of the swift current, and if stopped by
some obstruction could be held under the fire of the
batteries on both shores. General Putnam, therefore,
through his Quartermaster-General, contracted
with the Sterling Iron Works of Noble,
Townsend and Co., for an iron chain 500 feet long,
each link about two feet long, to be made of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
best Sterling iron 2¼ inches square, with a swivel
to every hundred feet and a clevis to every thousand
feet, for which the government was to pay $440
for every ton weight of chain and anchors.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="author">
<i>Photo White Studio</i></p>

<p class="caption">Artillery Target Practice</p></div>

<p>The chain was to obstruct the navigation of
the river. It was stretched across the narrowest
part on April 30, 1778, and fastened at West
Point in the second small cove west of Gee’s
Point, and on Constitution Island where the
present small boathouse and landing-place stand.
Very large logs, sixteen or more feet long, a little
pointed at the ends to lessen opposition to the
force of the water on flood and ebb, were used to
buoy up the great weight of the obstruction.
During the winter it was taken up, because the
ice in the river was an effective blockade, but
when spring came the work of 280 men was
needed to lay it across the stream.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Kosciusko labored strenuously on
the forts, so that by June, 1778, the work on the
fort in the northeast corner of the Plain begun
by de la Radière in the January past, was completed
and given the name of Fort Arnold. Later,
when Benedict Arnold turned traitor, its name
became Fort Clinton. A small portion of the
wall stands today. Washington, on a visit to
West Point in September, 1778, paid Kosciusko a
great compliment, stating to General Duportail,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
his chief engineer, that he need have no uneasiness
as to Kosciusko’s ability.</p>

<p>Additional troops were at this time sent to
West Point because Washington feared an attack
by the British. In the spring of 1779, General
McDougall was at West Point with three brigades;
there was one on Constitution Island, and the
main body of the Army was near Haverstraw
under General Putnam. Washington, ever
watchful, viewed with great concern the presence
of the British in the strong position of Stony
Point because he considered this post a serious
menace to West Point. Wishing to be rid of them
he sent for Anthony Wayne, gave him a corps
of light infantry, and directed him to capture the
British fort. A better man than Wayne could
not have been selected for the job. On the 15th
of July, Wayne paraded his troops for a minute
inspection, after which, instead of dismissing them,
he marched upon Stony Point, which at midnight
he successfully assaulted with the bayonet. The
news of his brilliant exploit was conveyed to
Washington in the following refreshing message:</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="smcap">West Point</span>, 16 July 1779.<br />

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Gen’l</span>:</p>

<p>The fort and garrison with Colonel Johnston are
ours. Our officers and men behaved like men who

<p class="author">
Yours most sincerely,<br />
<span class="smcap">Ant’y Wayne</span>.<br />
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span></p>

<p>To supervise better the defenses of the Hudson
River, Washington moved his headquarters to
West Point, in July, 1779, where he remained
until November of that year, occupying “Moore’s
House,” a structure that stood in Washington
valley near the shore of the Hudson, a short distance
from the northeast corner of the present
cemetery. It was built by John Moore prior to
1749, and called by all the people in the vicinity
“Moore’s Folly” on account of its pretentiousness.</p>

<p>General Clinton tried to draw Washington out
into the open country for a campaign, but the
American Commander was too astute and Clinton
dared not attack the Revolutionary forces at bay
at West Point because of the dangers of a campaign
in the Highlands.</p>

<p>Spurred on by Washington’s presence and by
his orders, Kosciusko and the troops completed
Fort Putnam and Redoubts Webb and Wyllys
in the summer. This work necessitated for fatigue
duty each day 2500 men, a large percentage of the
garrison. Even at this early period, West Point
was the Mecca for distinguished Americans and
foreigners. Nearly every Revolutionary commander
visited the Post at one time or another
during the war, and while Washington was here,
Count de Luzerne, the French minister, was his
guest.</p>

<p>Before Washington left the Post in late November,
the troops in the Highlands were distributed
to their winter stations. Little money was available
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
to equip properly the soldiers but they
struggled on bearing their burdens and hardships
that we of today might be free. That they were
not fighting for the present alone, without a thought
as to those who would come after them, is revealed
to us by an entry in a diary of General Heath
who was then in command of all the troops and
Posts on the Hudson:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>25th Nov. 1779. The troops were moving to their
different places of cantonment; many of the soldiers
(as fine men as ever stood in shoes) were marched
barefooted over the hard frozen ground, and with an
astonishing patience.</p>

<p><i>Remember these things, ye Americans in future
times!</i></p></blockquote>

<p>In the spring of 1780, Washington sent Baron
Steuben to West Point to drill the troops, for he
feared an attack by the British. This accomplished
officer, a Major-General in the American
Army, had seen seven campaigns in the service
of Frederick the Great, so that he brought to his
task a ripe experience. With Prussian thoroughness
he commenced drilling both the old soldiers
and recruits of the command, with the result that
by summer he was able to write to Washington
that he had formed a corps of light infantry
“that I dare flatter myself will be the admiration
of our allies as much as the terror of our enemies.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the patriotic work of the
officers and men of the Army, Washington was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
aware that America as well as Great Britain was
getting tired of the war. “There never has been
a stage of the war,” he said, “in which dissatisfaction
has been so general and so alarming.”
Governor Reed of Pennsylvania said in August,
1780: “It is obvious that the bulk of the people
are weary of the war.”</p>

<p>The stage was therefore set for the most dramatic
event of the Revolution, the treason of
Benedict Arnold. Had Arnold succeeded at this
period of the Revolution, the hour of darkness
and depression, in selling West Point to the
British, we would probably still be English colonies.
The loss of the Post would have shaken
the morale of the American commanders, not to
speak of the paralysis of any movement upon
which Washington’s army might have been engaged
at that particular time.</p>

<p>For more than a year previous to his assumption
of the command of West Point, Arnold had been
hatching nefarious schemes to betray the Americans.
He needed money badly, due to his extravagances
while in Philadelphia. His conduct
had not been entirely satisfactory while in that
city and open resentment was expressed on account
of his preference for the British faction,
but because of his military capacity he was held
in high esteem by Washington. His abilities
led Washington to offer him the command of the
left wing of the army then in the field, but he
pleaded that he was unfit for field duty by reason
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
of the wound that he had received at Saratoga, and
requested the command of West Point. His
desires were respected and on August 5, 1780,
he assumed command of his new post with headquarters
at the Robinson House.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>Once at West Point, Arnold saw his chance to
gain rank and pay from the British. He immediately
entered into a lively correspondence with
Major André, the Adjutant-General of the British
forces in America, who was addressed as “Mr.
John Anderson, Merchant.” Arnold’s communications
were all signed “Gustavus.” When negotiations
for the betrayal of West Point had
reached a crisis, Arnold requested a personal
interview with a representative of the British.
General Clinton then sent Major André up the
river on the sloop <i>Vulture</i> which anchored near
Haverstraw. An agent of Arnold’s, one Joshua
Hett Smith, returned at midnight, September 21,
with Major André in full uniform, a landing
being made a short distance north of the West
Shore Railroad tunnel south of Haverstraw.
Arnold and André then went to Smith’s house
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
in West Haverstraw. They were challenged by
an American sentinel and it was here that André
entered the American lines.</p>

<p>While the two officers were in consultation,
the American commander across the river brought
a four-pounder within range of the <i>Vulture</i>, and
opened a heavy fire upon her, causing her commander
to shift his anchorage downstream.
Great was André’s dismay at seeing his vessel
forced away, for now he was in the American
lines and far from New York. He had been
assured of a safe return to his own lines, and
disliked the idea of traveling alone by land to
New York. Moreover, he was very reluctant to
take off his uniform but at Arnold’s advice he
changed into civilian clothing, thereby foolishly
placing himself in the light of a spy, if caught
within the American lines. Arnold also gave
André important papers regarding the strength of
West Point defenses.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to imagine the state of André’s
mind at finding himself in a false position and at
the same time disobeying General Clinton’s orders,
which were not to change his uniform under any
circumstances nor receive any papers from Arnold.
Under the guidance of Joshua Smith, he
crossed the river at King’s Ferry (near Stony
Point of today) and proceeded south toward
New York.</p>

<p>Although furnished with a pass by Arnold, he
was detained by three American patriots near
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
Tarrytown, searched, and turned over to Colonel
Jameson at North Castle.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Arnold was at his Headquarters
at the Robinson House awaiting events, and
Washington was on his way from Hartford to
West Point. Had Arnold succeeded it is probable
that Washington would have fallen into the
enemy’s hands at this time, an accident that
would have ruined the Revolution. When Washington
was opposite West Point he sent two aides
to inform Arnold of his arrival. They proceeded
to the Robinson House and were enjoying Arnold’s
hospitality at breakfast when Jameson’s messenger
arrived with a note announcing André’s
capture. The news must have fallen upon Arnold
like a thunderbolt, but with perfect <i>sangfroid</i>
he excused himself, rushed upstairs to tell
his wife of the danger, ordered his horse, sent for
the coxswain of his barge, and then calmly returned
to his guests whom he told it was necessary
for him to cross to West Point to prepare
for the reception of General Washington. Instead,
he rapidly made his way down the river and boarded
the <i>Vulture</i> which took him to New York.</p>

<p>Major André was tried by court-martial,
found guilty of being a spy, and sentenced to
be hanged. Numerous letters were written to
Washington begging that André’s life be spared.
Arnold himself addressed to his former chief a
long communication exonerating André and taking
upon himself the blame for André’s presence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
in disguise within the American lines. Even
Hamilton was touched, saying: “Never perhaps
did any man suffer death with more justice or
deserve it less.”</p>

<p>André accepted his fate like a brave soldier
but he revolted from the ignominy of being hanged.
When all efforts to change the mode of his death
failed, he personally appealed to Washington in
the following splendid letter:</p>

<p class="caption"><i>From Maj. André to General Washington, 1780.</i></p>

<p class="author">
<span class="smcap">Tappan.</span><br />
The 1st. of Oct., 1780.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:</p>

<p>Buoy’d above the terror of death by the consciousness
of a life devoted to honorable pursuits
and stained with no action that can give me remorse,
I trust that the request that I make to your Excellency,
at this serious period and which is to soften my last
moments will not be rejected.</p>

<p>Sympathy toward a soldier will surely induce
your Excellency and a military tribunal to adapt the
mode of my death to the feelings of a man of honor.
Let me hope, Sir, that if aught in my character impresses
you with esteem towards me, if aught in my
misfortune marks me the victim of policy and not of
resentment, I shall experience the operation of those
feelings in your breast by being informed that I am
not to die on a gibbet.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be your Excellency’s most
obedient and most humble servant,</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="smcap">John André</span>,<br />
Adj. General to the British Army.<br />
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span></p>

<p>His request, however, was not granted and in the
early afternoon of October 2, 1780, arrayed in
full dress uniform he paid the penalty on the
scaffold. His body was buried beneath his gibbet
but removed to England in 1831 where it rests
in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>West Point and the Revolutionary cause was
saved to the Americans! The shock of Arnold’s
traitorous act with its narrowly averted consequences
caused Washington to take even more
stringent measures for West Point’s defense.
Orders were issued to continue work on all of the
fortifications and during 1781 and 1782, the
garrison labored faithfully and uncomplainingly
notwithstanding the great sufferings of the men
from lack of provisions. At times the stores on
hand were numbered by a few barrels of salt pork
and a little flour.</p>

<p>Major-General Knox now assumed command
of the Post. After the cessation of hostilities he
was very busy mustering out troops and putting
the garrison in shape.</p>

<p>Despite the poverty that prevailed at West
Point, Washington ordered a celebration to be
held in honor of the birth of the Dauphin of
France, Louis Joseph, the son of Louis XVI., born
October, 1781. A magnificent fête was arranged
in which all of the troops stationed in the Highlands
participated. Upon the Plain at West Point,
Major Villefranche erected a curious edifice,
an improvised temple with a grand colonnade of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
118 pillars made of the trunks of trees. The
entire building was festooned with American and
French flags, with designs and emblems, muskets
and bayonets fancifully arranged. Washington,
with a party of five hundred distinguished guests,
assembled in the colonnade for a banquet. A
series of thirteen toasts were drunk, each one
accompanied by a salute of thirteen cannon.
During the evening there was a grand display of
fireworks for the troops and a ball for the officers
and their guests. This dance, led by General
Washington, was the first real West Point hop.</p>

<p>The various details left over from the Revolution
were now disposed of by General Knox and
his successor, Lieut.-Col. Rochefontaine. The
genesis of the Military Academy was foreshadowed
by the presence of the Invalid Corps which by act
of Congress, 1777, was, among other things, “to
serve as a military school for young gentlemen
previous to their being appointed to marching
regiments.”</p>

<p>The dark days of the Revolution were over and
the troops could now rest from their strenuous
labors. There were important matters, however,
to occupy the leaders, not the least of which was
the establishment of an institution for training
officers for the Army. No lesson of the war was
so well learned as the need for such educated
leaders, and immediately the Revolution was
over, Washington, Hamilton, and Knox began
urging Congress to establish a National Military
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
Academy. Although Washington never lived to
see his recommendations carried out, he would
have rejoiced, I am sure, to know that Congress
three years after his death founded the United
States Military Academy, at his favorite Post,
West Point.

<span class="large">THE FIRST HUNDRED YEARS</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">When</span> at last the colonies found themselves
free, and realized that they were in no
immediate danger from any foe, the thoughts of
the people, so long occupied with war, eagerly
turned toward the establishment of their new
government. It was only natural that the Army,
weary of the long struggle for independence,
should gladly welcome their release from service,
and resume once again the peaceful pursuits of
civil life. For seven long years their days had
been filled with arduous marches through heat
and through snow, with tedious vigils on outposts,
or with bloody encounters with the British, and
the great mass of the people joyfully hailed the
piping times of peace, and without ado they
turned their battle-axes into billhooks, and their
helmets into beehives.</p>

<p>It could not be expected that during the reaction
that followed the Revolution much attention
would be given to the subject of military education.
As a matter of fact, for seven years this
question was allowed to sleep; but Washington,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
ever on the alert for the welfare of the new country,
suggested in his annual message of 1790 to
the Congress the establishment of a National
Military Academy. In spite of the great prestige
that he enjoyed both as President and as the man
who had successfully waged the Revolution, his
words were not heeded by Congress until some
years afterwards.</p>

<p>The Congress of those days apparently was like
our own and needed to have a matter brought to
its attention many times before any definite action
was taken. Washington undoubtedly appreciated
this condition for we find that on numerous
occasions he spoke of his plan, telling Congress
that “it is an inquiry that cannot be too strongly
pursued.” His efforts were not without reward,
for in 1794 the grade of Cadet was created, and a
military school was established at West Point.
This school was composed of the cadets who were
by law attached to the Engineer and Artillery
Corps of the garrison. In each company there
were two of these young men styled “cadets of
the Service,” whom the Government aimed to
train to become commissioned officers of the Army.
There was, however, no organization to the
school, nor scientific system of instruction, so
that the cadets did about as they pleased, pursuing
their studies in a desultory manner.</p>

<p>It was not until the 16th of March, 1802, that
the United States Military Academy was definitely
established by law. Congress then authorized
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
the President to organize the Corps of Engineers
whose cadre contained, in addition to the officers,
ten cadets. West Point was designated as
the station of the Corps which was to constitute
the Military Academy. The next year forty
cadets, to be appointed from the artillery troops
of the Army, were added and in 1808, 156 additional
men.</p>

<p>During the first ten years of its existence the
Military Academy was in a most chaotic condition.
It was in reality “a foundling barely
existing among the mountains, out of sight of,
and almost unknown to, its legitimate parents.”
It is greatly to be wondered at that the Academy
ever survived the terrible throes of its birth.
Almost no provisions for its existence were made
by Congress. The cadets were lodged in an old
barrack of the Revolution, called the “Long
Barrack,” that occupied the site of the present
hotel, and their instruction was given in a wooden
building called the “Academy” that stood on the
spot of the present Superintendent’s quarters.
They were allowed to board around promiscuously,
really living from hand to mouth. Among
the student body there was very little discipline,
but a great deal of idleness and dissipation.</p>

<p>In 1812, a new law placed the school on a firm
basis and furnished the principles upon which
the institution has been conducted to this moment.
Two hundred and fifty cadets were authorized
and the respectable sum of twenty-five thousand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
dollars appropriated for buildings. To
offset this good fortune, the Academy had to fight
against the hostility of Madison’s Secretary of
War, Eustis, who tried his utmost to strangle the
new-born institution. But happily the exigencies
of the War of 1812 frustrated his hostile designs.</p>

<p>Despite insuperable difficulties, the Academy
began to grow, not scientifically, but in a muddling
sort of way. Where the Superintendent had
heretofore been a rover up and down the Hudson
Posts, he now became permanently located at
West Point. The professors began to work
together with more harmony, going so far as to
recommend a broadly planned course that included
most of the subjects studied today. By
the Regulations of 1815, the cadets were required
to mess at a common table, instead of boarding
at private houses, their age limit was fixed at
fourteen to twenty, and their uniform was definitely
prescribed. A little order was being brought
out of chaos. Annual vacations were granted,
to commence immediately after the examination
in July and to end on the first day of August.
Notwithstanding the excellence of the above
features, the general condition of this infant
school was far from satisfactory. A picture of
its inner life is revealed in a letter written in 1815
by Andrew Ellicott, the Professor of Mathematics,
to the Secretary of War, in which he states:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Until I came here the Academy was abandoned by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
the Professors and a great part of the students from
the first of December until, the first of April following
every year. This practice I immediately put a stop
to, and kept the Academy open two winters, not even
excluding Sundays, without the aid of any other
Professor or regular assistant. The winter before
last, I kept together more than twenty students, 16
of whom were commissioned last July, and last winter
more than 80, some of whom would do credit
to any country or nation, and will be found among
our future rulers. These extra services are not ideal&mdash;they
are substantial.</p></blockquote>

<p>Although Professor Ellicott rather emphasizes
his assiduity in his application for extra compensation
we must be grateful, at least, for the glimpse
he gives us of the state of affairs in 1815.</p>

<p>Better days, however, were in store for West
Point. That the War Department was not entirely
insensible to the handicap under which
those at West Point were working, is proven by
the circumstance that at this particular time
there was in Europe an officer, Major Sylvanus
Thayer, who had been sent abroad “to prosecute
inquiries and examinations calculated for his
improvement in the military art.” He was given
five thousand dollars for the collection of books,
maps, and instruments for the Military Academy.
Shortly after his return, he was made Superintendent,
relieving Captain Alden Partridge whose
administration had not been popular nor very
successful. Although Captain Partridge was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
much criticized by the professors and cadets his
farewell address to the “Gentlemen Cadets of the
Military Academy” was so high-minded that I
am tempted to quote it in full:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Before I take my leave of you, gentlemen, permit
me to impress anew upon your minds some precepts
to which I have frequently before this called your
attention. Be attentive to your studies, and correct
and gentlemanly in your deportment. Pursue with
undeviating course the paths of virtue and true
honor; and rest assured that although the vicious
and the vain may affect to ridicule and despise, they
will inwardly respect you, and that you will thereby
ensure the applause of the good and the great, and,
which is of more importance, the approbation of your
consciences and of your God.</p></blockquote>

<p>With the advent of Major Thayer began the
golden age of the Academy. This officer was a
veteran of the War of 1812 in which he had served
with great distinction; he had studied the military
schools of France, and had profited by his
unusual opportunities to acquire a profound knowledge
concerning the conduct of an institution such
as the military school over which he was chief.</p>

<p>The great talents that Major Thayer possessed
were well employed. For sixteen years he shaped
the destiny of the Academy, and with such wisdom
and foresight that the broad fundamental
principles which he laid down for the school’s
guidance, govern the institution today.</p>

<p class="copy">From the Painting by Thomas Sully, Library U.S.M.A.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span></p></div>

<p>To him, more than to any one man, is due the
elevation of the Military Academy to its high
rank among schools of learning both in this country
and abroad.</p>

<p>Upon taking over the command, he immediately
drew upon his genius for organization, with
the result that the cadets were organized into a
battalion of two companies, a “Commandant of
Cadets” was created, the classes were for study
purposes divided into sections, transfers were made
between sections, and weekly reports, showing
daily progress in studies, were rendered. Moreover,
the system and scale of daily marks, the
publication of the <i>Annual Register</i>, the introduction
of the Board of Visitors, the check-book
system, the preponderating influence of the blackboard,
and the essential part of the modern Regulations
are proofs of his untiring efforts as an
executive. The above changes that he effected,
and the reforms that he introduced, are a part of
the modern organization of West Point. Perhaps
no one method has so much influenced the
quality of the instruction of the cadets as the
blackboard recitations. Major Thayer insisted
on this form, although old records show that it
was introduced at West Point by Mr. George
Baron, a civilian teacher, who in the autumn of
1801 gave to Cadet Swift “a specimen of his
mode of teaching at the blackboard.” Today
it is the prominent feature in Academic instruction.</p>

<p>Major Thayer’s success in giving West Point
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
an upward impetus had attracted general attention
and observation throughout the country so
that appointments were now sought after with
avidity. The politicians rejoiced at the Academy’s
increased importance and the consequent patronage
that the appointments offered. Although
the present law did not obtain, whereby Congressmen
appointed cadets, still it had been the custom
for the President to appoint men to West Point
upon the recommendation of a Representative.
In 1843, a law was passed that allowed one cadet
for each congressional district. Major Thayer
was at his own request relieved as Superintendent,
after a brilliant administration whose results
were so beneficial to the institution as to gain for
him from posterity the title of “Father of the
Military Academy.”</p>

<p>Could Major Thayer have only peered into
the future he would have seen Fame, years later,
crowning three of his raw young cadets. One of
the lads at West Point under Major Thayer was
Edgar Allan Poe, America’s foremost literary
genius. He entered West Point July 1, 1830, but
after a troublous stay of a little over eight months
was dismissed for repeated misconduct. Not a
great deal is known of his brief cadet days, but
his classmates have stated that he was irritable
and morose, and addicted to excessive drinking.
He would steal out of barracks sometimes, long after
taps, and “run it out” to “Old Benny Havens,”
a tavern kept by Benny Havens on the banks of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
the Hudson about a mile below West Point.
Benny Havens’ name is preserved in song and story
at West Point, and tales that surrounded the cadet
reunions in ye olden days at “Benny’s” are flavored
with all the romance of a mythical legend.
Old Benny died in 1877 at the ripe age of
eighty-nine years, but his name survives in a
stirring West Point song that I quote in part:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come fill your glasses, fellows, and stand up in a row,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For singing sentimentally we are going for to go,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Poe, however, was only one of many who disobeyed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
the regulations, but he did not care for
military life and made no effort to conceal his
offenses. Finally he was tried by court-martial.
For two weeks prior to his trial he neglected almost
all of his studies as a cadet. Two of the specifications
against him were for absences from parades
and roll calls and two for disobedience of orders,
but at the trial, he deliberately pleaded guilty
to the latter and not guilty to the former, the
most patent and obvious of his offenses. Whether
or not he did this from a sense of humor, is not
known, but his action was not calculated to help
him in the eyes of his superiors. He was dismissed
March 6, 1831. Four days later he wrote
Major Thayer the following letter:</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Letter of Edgar Allan Poe, Lately Cadet, U. S. M. A.,
to the Superintendent: 1831.</i><br />
(<i>Original in the library U. S. M. A.</i>)</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="smcap">New York</span>,<br />
Mar. 10, 1831.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:</p>

<p>Having no longer any ties to bind me to my country&mdash;no
prospects&mdash;nor friends&mdash;I intend by the first
opportunity to proceed to Paris with the view of

Fayette, an appointment (if possible) in the Polish
Army. In the event of the interference of France in

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>

<p>A certificate of standing in my class is all that I

<p class="author">

<span class="smcap">Edgar Allan Poe</span>.<br />
</p>

<p>Poe, however, abandoned the plan and little
more was heard of his whereabouts by his friends
at West Point.</p>

<p>The two other cadets under Major Thayer,
were Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee, but
their history is too well known to bear repetition
here. Suffice to say that Jefferson Davis was
mischievous and human enough as a cadet to be
court-martialed for an escapade.</p>

<p>The prosperity of the Academy continued in
spite of its opponents in Congress who, just prior
to the Mexican War, came near accomplishing
its overthrow, but the brilliant achievements of
its graduates in that conflict silenced for a while
their mutterings. Many young officers who
served with distinction in this war were later to
win greater fame in the titanic Civil War. Grant
(class of ’43); Sherman (’40); Hancock (’44);
Thomas (’40); Meade (’35); Hooker (’30); Sedgwick
(’37) participated in the campaigns against
the Mexicans.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span></p>

<p>The nation was given ample proof of the wisdom
of Washington, Hamilton, and Knox in their
efforts to establish a Military Academy wherein
officers might be educated and trained to organize
and discipline citizen soldiers, and lead
them to victory. At West Point today there are
bronze cannon, tattered flags, and mutilated
flagstaffs, trophies of the Mexican War that were
presented to the Academy by General Winfield
Scott, the Commanding General of the Army,
who stated, “as under Providence it is mainly
to the Military Academy that the United States
became indebted for those brilliant achievements
and other memorable victories in the same war,
I have a lively pleasuring in tendering the seven
trophies (semi-national) to the mother of so many
accomplished soldiers and patriots.”</p>

<p>The close of the Mexican War found the Military
Academy the pet and idol of the National
Legislature. All of its requirements were solicitously
studied and plenty of funds were forthcoming
to supply its wants. As time went on, however,
and no foe appeared at our door, the usual
indifference on the part of some toward military
affairs, and the open hostilities of others, were
manifested. As before in its history, the Academy
became the object of numerous attacks, but it
ignored them, continuing unobtrusively the preparation
of her cadets for their future work, little
realizing how important this work was soon to be.</p>

<p>In 1852, Brevet-Colonel R. E. Lee, Corps of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
Engineers, class of 1829, was appointed Superintendent.
Under his administration the course
was extended to include five years, embracing
more English studies and Military Law. A new
riding hall was completed in 1855 which greatly
increased the opportunity for cavalry exercises.
Colonel Lee, having transferred to the Cavalry
arm of the Service, was relieved as Superintendent,
April, 1855, because according to law at that
time, only Engineer officers could serve as Superintendent.</p>

<p>The year before Lee’s administration began,
there entered West Point in July, 1851, a cadet,
James Abbott McNeill Whistler, aged sixteen years
and eleven months, destined to become one of America’s
greatest artists. Whistler remained three
years at West Point when he was discharged for
deficiency in chemistry. In speaking in after years
of his experiences with this study, he said, “Had
silicon been a gas, I would have been a Major-General.”
He was called up for examination in
the subject of chemistry, which also covered the
studies of mineralogy and geology, and given
silicon to discuss. When called upon to recite,
he stated: “I am required to discuss the subject
of silicon. Silicon is a gas.” “That will do, Mr.
Whistler,” said the Professor, and the artist
soldier retired quickly to private life.</p>

<p>Another story was told of him in an examination
in history. “What!” said an officer who was
his instructor, “you do not know the date of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
Battle of Buena Vista? Suppose you were to go
out to dinner and the company began to talk of
the Mexican War, and you, a West Point man,
were asked the date of the battle. What would
you do?”</p>

<p>“Do,” said Whistler, “why, I should refuse to
associate with people who would talk of such
things at dinner.”</p>

<p>Although Whistler was not a success in defining
silicon or remembering dates, he excelled in drawing,
standing at the head of his class. The
Professor of Drawing at the time was Robert W.
Weir, an artist of no mean ability himself and of
generally recognized standing. For Whistler, Professor
Weir always had a high esteem on account
of the unusual talent he displayed in the drawing
classes. Specimens of his work as a cadet are
still preserved at West Point.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In 1860, the rumblings of trouble over the slave
question began to be heard even in the secluded
Highlands of the Hudson. At first the Southern
and Northern cadets ardently advocated the views
of their respective States, arguing with all of the
warmth and enthusiasm of their young natures
but without any particular bitterness. Soon,
however, the gathering of the war clouds and the
noise of the storm that was brewing brought the
Southern cadets face to face with a problem that
of its nature was most difficult to solve. Each
one had sworn allegiance to the Government and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
taken an oath to defend it against all enemies.
What should they do? To remain and support
the Federal Government meant to fight against
their own flesh and blood, yet to resign was to
break one’s sworn word. As a Southerner myself,
I have often reflected upon the mental suffering
that those fellow cadets of “the long grey line”
must have experienced, trying to decide upon their
duty. General Schaff, in <i>The Spirit of Old West
Point</i>, gives us a vivid picture of those days at
the Academy. So much has been written about
the cadets who left West Point to fight with the
Southern forces that the following data may prove
interesting.</p>

<p>At the outbreak of the Civil War there were
from the Southern States eighty-six cadets. Of
this number sixty-three resigned, from various
causes connected with the war, leaving twenty-one
who remained loyal to the Government. In
the Army, it is a remarkable fact that of the officers
of Southern blood appointed from civil life,
one half went with the Confederacy, whereas only
one fifth of the West Pointers went South. One
hundred and sixty-two Southern graduates withstood
the terrible strain of fighting their own
people, and remained true to the flag.</p>

<p>Although up to the time of the Civil War no
graduates of West Point had been appointed to
the rank of general officer, the war had not been
in progress a year before the country eagerly
turned to men from the Academy to lead its armies.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
In September, 1861, six of the eleven generals in
the Regular Army were graduates. At the conclusion
of the war sixteen of the seventeen Regular
general officers of the line were graduates. Sixty-six
graduates rose during the war to the grade of
major-general and 112 to that of brigadier-general
of volunteers, which means that more than one
third of the graduates engaged in the war rose to
the grade of general officer. Nine received the
thanks of Congress for conspicuous gallantry.</p>

<p>Turning to the Confederate forces, we find a
similar state of affairs. Of the West Pointers in
the Confederate service, eighteen were made full
generals, fifteen lieutenant-generals, forty major-generals,
and eighty-eight brigadier-generals. In
command of all was Jefferson Davis, President
of the Confederacy, and a West Pointer.</p>

<p>The most famous West Pointer on the Union
side was Ulysses S. Grant, class of 1843, but
scarcely less noted were Sheridan (’53), and
Sherman (’45). Other graduates whose services
were most conspicuous follow: George H. Thomas
(’40), Meade (’35), Hooker (’35), Sedgwick (’37),
McClellan (’46), Halleck (’39), McPherson (’53),
Rosecrans (’42), Warren (’50), Pleasanton (’44),
and Gregg (’55).</p>

<p>On the Confederate side we find Lee (’29),
Early (’37), Jackson (’46), A. S. Johnston (’26),
A. P. Hill (’47), Daniel H. Hill (’42), and Longstreet
(’42), Ewell (’40), and Stuart (’54).</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the Civil War, a struggle between
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
three million combatants, all of the armies
in the field on both sides were commanded by graduates;
nearly all of the corps; a large majority
of the divisions; the staff corps or organization
of supply of both forces, and many of the brigades.
Every important battle of the war was commanded
on one or both sides by a graduate&mdash;generally
both. This was the verdict of the end of the
great conflict after a test to which no other institution
of learning has ever been put.</p>

<p>After the Civil War the Academy began to
drop out of public notice because the people were
more interested in the commercial development of
the country. Apathy on the part of the public
has never, however, affected West Point’s attitude
toward its duty, so that year after year graduates
were sent forth to fight the Indians upon the
Plains where they underwent great hardships
of which the country was ignorant.</p>

<p>Then came the Spanish War to test again the
product of the Academy, but the work of the
graduates in Cuba and the Philippines gave ample
proof that the metal was still good and well
stamped.</p>

<p>With the advent of Colonel A. L. Mills as
Superintendent, the Academy received a fresh
impetus and many important changes were
effected. The Corps in 1900 was increased by
one hundred cadets, hazing in all of its forms was
practically abolished after a long bitter fight,
and elaborate plans were inaugurated for the enlargement
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
and rebuilding of West Point. In
this connection the late Colonel Charles W.
Larned, Professor of Drawing, distinguished himself.
It is largely due to his indefatigable efforts
and to the foresight and ability of the late General
Mills, and to the Secretary of War, Elihu Root,
that West Point has its magnificent new buildings.
Their construction extended over a long
period, from 1904 to 1911, during which time the
courses were expanded and improved to meet the
needs of our new Army.</p>

<p>Once again the country is at war, this time with
the most powerful and resourceful enemy that
our citizens have been called upon to face.</p>

<p>The graduates of West Point will prove as true
to their traditions in this struggle as they have in
the past, and West Point knows that they will
return in triumph to their Alma Mater who ever
stands ready to press the cup of greeting to the
lips of all honorable and loyal sons.

<span class="large">THE REALIZATION OF AN ARCHITECT’S DREAM</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">When</span> the springtime rolls around and the
Hudson River is at its best, the annual
influx of visitors begins to arrive at West Point.
Trains and boats disgorge official visitors, tourists,
boy scouts, delegations of various brotherhoods
and sisterhoods, and picknickers galore. Little
groups of them appear in all corners of the Post,
in the area of Barracks, on the Plain, in the Public
Buildings, and along the famous Flirtation Walk.
Their chief interest, of course, is to catch a glimpse
of the cadets, either <i>en masse</i> or individually.
When the Corps starts either to meals or to dress
parade, they gather along the sidewalks, or at the
visitors’ seats to watch the marching. Some openly
express their enthusiasm and pleasure, genuinely
delighted at everything they see, while others remain
silent and phlegmatic apparently taking only
a languid interest in their surroundings.</p>

<p>As I watch my fellow-countrymen strolling
about the grounds of the Academy, I often wonder
what are their impressions of this institution.
To many, of course, the historic traditions of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
West Point, as well as its functions and purposes,
are thoroughly familiar, but to a vast majority
West Point is a closed book. They see the cadets,
the drills, the buildings, perhaps parade, but they
never have an opportunity to acquaint themselves
with the intimate life of the Academy. They
do not derive the full benefit from their visit,
because they are in the position of regarding the
institution from the outside. In many cases,
the spirit of investigation is restrained by a feeling
of timidity upon their part, a feeling of awe in
the face of military surroundings.</p>

<p>The Army is so little known to the people in
the United States, that, to the average civilian,
there seems to be some sort of mystery surrounding
military life, and the presence of a man in
uniform, with a waist belt and pistol, doing plain
police duty, appears to act as a check on every
natural impulse. The pleasure of his visit is
consequently marred to some extent and he feels
somewhat ill-at-ease. He wants to investigate
with greater freedom, but he shrinks from being
told that his projects are “Verboten.” Upon
his departure he must of necessity have but a
superficial idea of the great work done at the
Academy, unless he has been fortunate enough to
have some friend stationed at West Point who
dissipates the apparently cold atmosphere of
military life.</p>

<p>I have often regretted, as I watched the crowds
swarming around, that each individual might not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
carry away a real appreciation of West Point,
instead of leaving with only the most superficial
impressions. Unless one has graduated from the
Academy it is impossible to seize fully the spirit
of the institution, or have a clear idea of its intimate
life. My long familiarity with West Point,
both as a cadet and as an officer, prompts me
to portray for the American people the history,
aims, ideals, and spirit of their National Military
Academy.</p>

<p class="caption">Class Formation in the Area of Barracks</p></div>

<p>West Point seen for the first time from the river,
whether in sunshine or through the mists, is a
sight not soon forgotten. The monumental Riding
Hall that rises out of the cliff of which it seems
to form a part, first fixes the eye, but as one’s
glance wanders a little higher it drinks in the
towering pile of Post Headquarters; higher yet,
the eye rests for a moment on the crenelated
border of the roof of the Academic Building, and
then, higher still, it pauses to contemplate the
beauty of West Point’s crowning architectural
achievement, the Cadet Chapel. For a moment
the beholder seems withdrawn from the sordid
material world, and filled with a multitude of
noble impressions. He experiences a spiritual uplift
as he admires the majestic simplicity and
grandeur of the buildings, an architectural triumph
worthy to have inspired Ruskin’s beautiful
thought, “frozen music.”</p>

<p>When the Government determined to rebuild
West Point, nearly fifteen years ago, the presence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
of two fine buildings of Gothic design&mdash;the Library
and the Cadet Barracks&mdash;decided the style of architecture.
These two buildings ranked as perhaps
the most successful examples of the Collegiate
Gothic that was much in vogue for educational
institutions in the country half a century ago. A
limited competition was held for designs and all
architects who had distinguished themselves in
Gothic work were invited to participate. Several
beautiful designs for a Renaissance treatment were
offered, but one group of architects, Cram, Goodhue,
and Ferguson, submitted drawings for so admirable
a Gothic treatment that they received the
unanimous approval of a board of judges composed
of eminent architects. The construction of the
new buildings lasted over a period of about seven
years, during which time the work was under the
direction of Colonel John M. Carson, Jr., Quartermaster,
who was representing the Government.
In writing a book on West Point, any mention
of the buildings involves the name of Colonel
Carson who performed his difficult work with an
unusual amount of zeal and intelligence. The
result is that the new buildings are splendidly
constructed, and because the architects had an
eye for harmony these structures seem to grow
out of the rocks upon which they stand, emphasizing
rather than detracting from West Point’s
natural beauty.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_040" src="images/i_040.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">The Administration Building</p></div>

<p>The north road from the station passes first,
on the river side, the Power House built of granite
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
from local quarries. It is designed to supply
the entire institution with electricity for light
and power, and the central buildings with heat
from exhaust steam. In a building of this nature,
a factory-like look would be taken for granted and
pardoned, but, on the contrary, its design is not
only adapted for its function, but the building
forms an important link in the architectural whole.
It assumes its place quite naturally and modestly,
almost unobtrusively in the natural landscape, tying
the buildings in the upper terrace with the base.
The tall smoke-stack is cleverly concealed within
the walls of an imposing granite tower.</p>

<p>On a slightly higher level, and paralleling the
river, is the Riding Hall splendidly impressive
with its broad flat buttresses. The latter seem
almost akin to the classic order, and serve in a
very large measure to reconcile the classicism
of the neighboring Cullum Memorial Hall,&mdash;an
exotic among its surroundings&mdash;with the dominant
Gothic of the place. The present Riding
Hall occupies the site of not only the old hall,
but also of the old Cavalry stables, and barracks.
The old hall was built in 1855 and, for the number
of cadets at West Point during the ensuing
fifty years, it was sufficiently large. With the increase
of the Corps of Cadets, and the quickened
interest throughout the Service in equitation,
however, more spacious accommodations for instruction
were required. Usually when a building
has served a useful and honorable purpose for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
many years, its demolition is generally viewed
with regret. There was, however, no sentimental
attachment for the Riding Hall. Many a painful
hour had cadets spent within its walls learning
to ride on the bare back of a raw-boned horse,
or floundering around in the spongy tanbark.</p>

<p>In the little plaza at the junction of the Power
House and Riding Hall, the road winds and passes
under the mediæval arch of the Post Headquarters,
or Administration Building. At this point, the
bulk and dignity of the buildings are stupendous,
and admiringly we stand, imprisoned, it would
seem, in a quadrangle of Middle Age fortresses,
whose sternness and solemnity seem symbolic of
discipline and strength. The main entrance to
the Riding Hall branches from the road a few paces
beyond the arch, the lower level of the galleries
being reached by a flight of steps that cling to
the steep retaining wall of the road. The great
arena is 150 by 600 feet and is covered by a cantilever
roof, so that when the eye first encounters
this interior, a sensation of its vastness holds
the spectator in its grip. The roof is mostly of
glass so as to afford a maximum of light, and the
floor is covered with tanbark to make more endurable
any sudden and unexpected descent from
the back of a capricious beast. The building is
steam-heated and electric lighted, for during the
winter months, equitation drills extend into the
late afternoon. The hall can be divided by curtains
into three smaller halls, a scheme that permits
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
three classes to undergo instruction at the
same time. In one portion of the hall are stalls
for one hundred mounts, but the majority of
the horses are kept at the cavalry barracks. The
hall is so large that during the winter months
the U. S. M. A. Battery of Artillery uses it for a
drill ground, thereby keeping the horses in good
condition and the men well instructed. Moreover,
the officers and cadets are enabled to keep up their
practice in polo. Every Wednesday and Saturday
afternoon, teams of cadets play each other, or try
their skill against civilian opponents. Along the
full length of the west wall, and the north and south
end, are balconies for the accommodation of visitors
who are welcome whenever the hall is open.</p>

<p>Passing once more under the arch, we admire
again for a moment the graceful Herculean proportions
of the Administration Building whose
imposing square tower, tipped with four smaller
towers at the corners, rises precipitately one hundred
and sixty feet. It is an interesting fact in
these days of steel construction that this tower is
built of solid masonry. At the southeast angle
of the building, on a level with the base of the
main floor, is an enormous eagle carved in granite,
its head high, its wings outstretched and flattened
back proudly against the two sides of the edifice, as
if proclaiming to the world its mission of protection
over the Academy whose administrative
heart is enclosed in this structure. As we ascend
the stairway, alongside the basement at the left,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
we pass a large Gothic window which affords light
to a vaulted hall used for courts-martial. The
interior of this hall is in keeping with the mediæval
donjon appearance of the whole building, and
of such a chill and forbidding aspect as to inspire
in the accused a feeling of guilt, <i>nolens volens</i>.
The flight of stairs mounts to the level of the
Post proper where an eastern view of the building
is disclosed. A large sally-port leads into the
court around which the building is constructed.</p>

<p>The exterior walls are ornamented with shields
representing the coats-of-arms of various states,
territories, and foreign possessions prepared from
the official seals, and expressed according to the
laws of Heraldry. The only coat-of-arms of an
individual is that of George Washington, at the
top of the east elevation of the courtyard. The
obverse and reverse of the great seal of the United
States will be found above the east and west
entrances, respectively, of the sally-port. Flanking
the obverse of the great seal are the seal of
the War Department and the device of the Corps
of Engineers. In addition to the shields, the
devices of the various staff departments, usually
associated with a headquarters, have been placed
in the sally-port. Two of them, the Adjutant-General’s
Department, and the Quartermaster’s
Department, are on shields on the north side
of the sally-port, and the Subsistence Department,
Signal Corps, Pay Department, Ordnance
Department, Inspector-General’s Department,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
Judge-Advocate-General’s Department, Medical
Department, and Chaplain’s Corps, are on corbels
at the bases of the ribs of the arch.</p>

<p>Upon the second floor is the Academic Board
room, a Gothic hall illuminated with stained glass
windows containing emblems of the various arts
and sciences. The most striking feature of the
room is the massive stone mantel, modeled by
Laurie and ornamented with statuettes of the
world’s greatest warriors.</p>

<p>The description of the statuettes and the reasons
for selecting the subject are given in a letter to Dr.
Holden, late librarian, dated November 23, 1906.
An Advisory Board of officers recommended:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That the character of the figures on the mantlepiece
be of a general military type&mdash;historical or legendary&mdash;best
suited to harmonize with the architectural
treatment and selected by the architects themselves
from the three lists in this letter of November 23, 1906.</p></blockquote>

<p>The heads appearing at the top of the mantel&mdash;in
the crenelations&mdash;have no relation to the
statuettes underneath. The small shields immediately
below the statuettes are, however, indicative
of the subjects as follows:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joshua.</span> Sun and Moon&mdash;taken from the Biblical
legend describing the distinctly miraculous
standing still of the Sun on the occasion of a certain
battle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hector of Troy.</span> Mycenæan Scroll&mdash;a sort
of triangular fylfot, which stands for Mycenæan
civilization. This device would apply equally
to that of Troy of which Hector was the greatest
figure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">David.</span> King of all Israel, warrior and psalmist&mdash;the

of a little sling, especially since the head of Goliath
is under the foot of the figure above.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexander the Great.</span> A conventionalized

part of his own coat-of-arms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judas Maccabeus.</span> The hammer&mdash;which is
the actual meaning of the name “Maccabeus.”</p>

<p>In the mantel, the figures are arranged chronologically
and historically. Three of them, <i>i. e.</i>,
Hector, Alexander, and Cæsar, were Heathen; three
were Christians, viz.: Charlemagne, King Arthur,
and Godfrey; and three were Jews, viz.: Joshua,
David, and Judas.</p>

<p>The choice of subjects was suggested to the
architects by Caxton’s preface to the first volume
of Sir Thomas Malory’s <i>Morte d’Arthur</i>, from
which the following quotation covering the choice
of the figures is taken:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>For it is notorly known through the universal
world, that there be nine worthy and the best that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
ever were, that is to wit, three Paynims, three Jews,
and three Christian men. As for the Paynims, they
were to-fore the Incarnation of Christ, which were
named, the first Hector of Troy, of whom the history
is comen both in ballad and in prose, the second Alexander
the Great, and the third Julius Cæsar, Emperor
of Rome, of whom the histories be well known and
had. And as for the three Jews, which were also
to-fore the Incarnation of our Lord, of whom the
first was Duke Joshua which brought the children of
Israel into the land of behest, the second David, King
of Jerusalem, and the third Judas Maccabeus, of these
three the Bible rehearseth all their noble histories
and acts. And since the said Incarnation have
been three noble Christian men, stalled and admitted
through the universal world into the number of the
nine best and worthy. Of whom was first the noble
Arthur. The second was Charlemain, or Charles the
Great, of whom the history is had in many places,
both in French and English. And the third and last
was Godfrey of Boloine.</p></blockquote>

<p>Upon the same floor as the Academic Board
room are the three offices of the Superintendent,
the Adjutant, and the clerks. The Headquarters
building houses, moreover, the offices of the
Treasurer, the Quartermaster, the printing shops,
the Post Office, and the Ordnance Museum, the
entrance to which is at the left of the sally-port.
Begun in 1854, the Museum has throughout the
years gathered some valuable trophies of war, interesting
relics, and models of the arms of all
nations. Visitors are well repaid by a visit to this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
interesting spot. Historic relics abound in the
rooms. I might mention among them a portion
of the flagstaff that was at Fort Sumter in 1861;
presentation swords belonging to distinguished
American generals; General Grant’s uniform and
horse equipment; mementoes of the Philippine
insurrection and of the war with Spain, not to
speak of a rare and beautiful collection of weapons
of all kinds. Not the least interesting part of
the exhibit are the trophies of the Revolution. In
glass cases are preserved five flags captured by the
American army during the Revolution, two of
which were British royal colors, and three taken
from the German mercenaries sent over by King
George. The former were taken at Yorktown. All
these flags were originally the property of General
Washington by whom they were bequeathed to
George Washington Parke Custis, the son of his
adopted son, and grandson of Mrs. Washington.
He in turn bequeathed them to the War Department,
which came into possession of them in 1858.
The same year Secretary Floyd presented them to
the Academy.</p>

<p>Across the road from the Administration Building
is the Cadet Mess. It is one of the oldest
buildings, the main part dating from 1850. The
architecture conforms in a general way to that
of the new buildings. With its broad pavement
in front, it sets well back from the road, possessing
not only the dignity of its more imposing neighbors,
but in addition a certain quaint charm.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span></p>

<p>The large central doors give access to the main
hall whose walls are hung with portraits of distinguished
graduates, chiefly the former Superintendents
of the Academy. Perhaps the most interesting
painting is that of General Robert E. Lee, who
was Superintendent in 1852. Frequently I have
heard visitors express surprise that General Lee’s
portrait should hang in the halls of the National
Military Academy, notwithstanding he was a graduate
and afterwards a Superintendent. The fact
that he fought against the Union, they argue,
should preclude the bestowal of the honor.
West Point, however, considers that since we are
a united people once more, his record should be
recognized by his Alma Mater from whom he
learned the lessons that brought him his fame
and his glory.</p>

<p>Symmetrically arranged in the hall are the mess
tables. They are made to accommodate ten cadets,
but occasionally, here and there, two tables
are shoved together for economy of floor space.
At these tables are twenty cadets. It is a pleasure
to enter the Mess Hall prior to any meal. Every
table is immaculate with its snowy clean cloth,
its polished cutlery, and shining crockery. The
cadets are not seated by classes but by companies,
each company having a certain number of tables
in the section of the hall assigned its battalion.
As a rule, the ten messmates are made up of three
first classmen, two second classmen, two third
classmen, and three fourth classmen. The latter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
are given, by custom of the Corps, various duties
to perform at mess such as carving the meat, procuring
the coffee and milk.</p>

<p>Three long passageways lead from the main
dining-hall to the kitchen. At first glance the
super-cleanliness of the surroundings strikes the
observer, but his attention is soon attracted to
the numerous clever devices for cooking, and for
saving time and labor. The preparation of the food
for cooking occurs outside of the kitchen proper.
Each department prepares its kind, whereupon it
is carried to the chef to be cooked and served.
The labor of preparation is greatly reduced by
the liberal use of machinery. A clever electrical
machine rapidly peels the potatoes, a whole
bushel of them, in a few minutes; other contrivances
make and cut the bread, sterilize the milk,
freeze the ice-cream; and wash and dry the innumerable
dishes. Without the aid of these labor-saving
devices it would be impossible to maintain
such an excellent mess for the cadets. Even now
the capacity of the plant is tested almost to its
limit, and with the increase in the Corps to 1200
cadets, it will be necessary either to enlarge the
present Cadet Mess or to build a new hall. The
disappearance of the present Mess, Grant Hall,
will be viewed with great regret by many graduates
who dined for four long years within its
really historic walls.</p>

<p>South of the Cadet Mess is the Hospital for
cadets, a large granite building perched on a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
terrace, well back from the road. It consists of a
central portion of three stories and basement,
with two wings of two stories each and basement.
The older portions date from 1875, but the wings
are of more recent construction. The wings are
practically detached from the main portion of
the building for the possible isolation of cases.
The equipment is, of course, modern in every
respect. Each wing contains two wards, making
four in all, named respectively Cuyler, McElderry,
McParlin, and Wheaton in honor of former distinguished
military surgeons on duty at West
Point. I do not suppose that there is a building
on the Post which arouses in cadets so many
different kinds of feeling. To some it is a place
to be avoided, but to a large number, especially
to those who succeed in entering for minor ailments,
it is viewed as a haven of rest. It is the
one place where the cadets are free from the irksome
routine, where there is no reveille, and where
the convalescents revel in what appears to them
epicurean feasts. Vatel, the famous French chef,
never enjoyed more renown than does the cook
at the hospital.</p>

<p>Almost every cadet has a secret longing to be
in the hospital at least for a short period during
his course, and those who “break in” for slight
ailments are regarded with a special esteem by
their fellows. One of the first adages that a
plebe learns at West Point is “faint heart never
broke into the hospital.” The surgeons, however,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
are pretty clever men and they size up the
situation very clearly in each case.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_052" src="images/i_052.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">The North Cadet Barracks</p></div>

<p>I remember that upon one occasion when I
was a cadet, a group of convalescents were, one
winter day, holding a mutual congratulatory
meeting in one of the wards, the burden of the
conversation being their luck and also their skill
in remaining so long in this abode of rest. Arthur
C&mdash;&mdash;, who was the most successful of the disciples
of the “rest cure,” was perched upon a bed explaining
to an admiring line of heads in little
snow-white cots, the strategy necessary to remain
in the ward, finishing his discourse oratorically;
“Some may come and some may go but <i>I</i> stay
on forever!” when the door opened and in walked
the surgeon. Cadet C&mdash;&mdash; was next day returned
to duty.</p>

<p>The officer in charge of the hospital is the Post
Surgeon, who is assisted by three or four captains
of the Medical Corps, and by several Dental
Surgeons. These officers are also in charge of
the Soldiers’ Hospital, a separate building for the
enlisted men of the garrison, and are responsible
for the general health of the command.</p>

<p>The chief buildings of the Academy occupy
relatively a small area of ground. Just north of
the Cadet Mess and flanking the main road are
the two Academic buildings, known as the East
and West Academic. The East building is new,
having been completed in 1913, one of the last
provided for in the rebuilding of West Point.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
The West Academic building, which was completed
in 1895, is built of Massachusetts granite
and cost about five hundred thousand dollars.
In this building are located the Departments of
Civil and Military Engineering, Mathematics,
Law, Drawing, Ordnance and Gunnery, and
English and History; in the East building the
Departments of Modern Languages, Chemistry
and Electricity, Natural and Experimental Philosophy.
The latter building is provided with
the most modern lecture rooms, electrical and
chemical laboratories, besides a mineralogical
and geological museum. The major portion of
both buildings contain the section rooms for
recitation purposes. Visitors are admitted if
accompanied by an officer.</p>

<p>The architecture of both of these buildings is
Gothic, but that of the new or East building is of
a more exquisite beauty. Splendidly situated,
it gives the impression of bulk and mass, much
the same feeling that one has in regarding a dreadnought
for the first time, but this impression soon
gives way to an appreciation of a certain delicacy
of treatment, a simple dignity that pleases. One
of the best impressions of its beauty is obtained
about dusk when the evening mists dim its outlines
and its surface is bathed in shadows relieved
only by the glimmering of the mediæval lanterns
on either side of the main door.</p>

<p>Immediately facing the center of the East
Academic Building and across the road, is a large
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
opening known as a sally-port through which the
sections of cadets must march to recitations in
the East Academic building. This passageway
connects the main road with the area of barracks,
a space of ground that derives its name from the
brown-stone buildings that bound a portion of its
perimeter. Along one side is a cement walk on
which the cadets form to be marched to their
recitations, and a sidewalk borders the barracks.
With the exception of a small plot of grass near
the Academic building the area is devoid of verdure,
but is covered with a fine gravel that gives
a clean and well-groomed appearance to the
ground. The word “Area” has great connoting
power. To a large number of cadets, it vividly
brings to mind the punishment tours that they
wearily trudged on Wednesday and Saturday
afternoons across its surface. To the majority,
however, it is the “hub” of cadet life, the assembly
place for recitations, sometimes for meals; the
scene of many an inspection or a guard mount,
and most important of all, it contains a small
insignificant building with a clock tower where
dwell the Commandant of Cadets and his assistants,
the Tactical officers.</p>

<p>The building on the north and west of the area
is the South Cadet Barracks, built in 1848. This
edifice, of 360 feet frontage, is constructed of
native granite, with crenelations and cornices of
red sandstone, and the Elizabethan style of its
architecture harmonizes perfectly with the Gothic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
of the new buildings. In fact, the old Cadet
Barracks is one of West Point’s handsomest
buildings. There are two hundred rooms in
the building, 14 × 22 feet, each planned to accommodate
two cadets. It is completely supplied
with modern plumbing, heating, and electric
lights. The barracks are divided into divisions,
each containing sixteen rooms. There is no
lateral communication between the divisions, but
a certain number of them are assigned to a company,
according to its strength. At present the
1st Bn. Cos. A, B, C, and D are quartered here.</p>

<p>I have often stood in the Area of Barracks and
looked through the north sally-port to enjoy the
fine vista that it framed. A section of the Plain
fills half the picture, a beautiful foreground,
either when resignedly spread out to the heat
of the Highland summer, or shivering under its
fleecy blanket of snow, over which the winter
winds angrily blow. In the upper half against
the far-away background of the Highland hills
is the slender flagstaff, sometimes swathed in the
folds of our national emblem, sometimes resisting
with all its strength the fluttering of its precious
charge which seems to implore its release to join
the flight of the breeze.</p>

<p>As we leave the north sally-port and turn toward
the angle between the two sets of barracks, high
on the hill the monumental Cadet Chapel, West
Point’s spiritual fortress, looms above with extraordinary
effectiveness. It has a fine site on a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
commanding spur just above the old Cadet Barracks
on the west, from which point it dominates
the Post. It lies in the shadow of old Fort Putnam
of Revolutionary fame, and, built of stone
quarried from its own hill, it seems a part of its
naturally beautiful surroundings.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_056" src="images/i_056.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">The Chapel</p></div>

<p>This edifice is in reality a large church with a
seating capacity of fourteen hundred persons. In
plan it is a crucifix, surmounted by a large central
tower whose parapet is 130 feet above the
pavement of the interior and 420 feet above
the level of the river. The tower contains two
stories: the bell-ringer’s story and the belfry above.
There are as yet no chimes, but on national holidays,
Christmas morning, and Easter, the band
mounts to the bell-ringer’s story, and the airs
appropriate for the day float out through the
louver windows in a weird and mysterious manner,
as if some invisible symphony was playing in
the clouds.</p>

<p>Just above the stately clerestory windows, and
around the cornice of the building, is a row of
carved figures, little bosses, representing the quest
of the Holy Grail. Over the door of the main entrance
is a great two-handed sword, Excalibur.</p>

<p>One should pause for a moment on the terrace
in front of the main entrance to enjoy the magnificent
panorama. In the distance, flows the
Hudson winding among the Highland hills, and
skirting the great Plain along whose edge stand
the Bachelor Building, Cullum Hall, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
Officers’ Mess. Directly below, in the shelter of
the chapel hill, are grouped all of the main buildings
pertaining to the cadets, the most conspicuous
of which are the barracks. Viewed from this
height the arrangement of the buildings resembles
a regular nest, <i>le nid des cadets</i>.</p>

<p>A winding road back of the barracks leads to
the Chapel. The interior of the Chapel is 200
feet long, and across the transepts, 72 feet wide.
The nave contains fourteen large Gothic windows,
now filled with temporary glass but which will
later be replaced with memorial windows.</p>

<p>The jewel of the interior is the great chancel
window, with its noble inscription:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Erected to the glory of the God of Battles and in
faithful memory of the departed graduates of the
United States Military Academy, West Point, by the
living alumni.</p></blockquote>

<p>The deep shades of purple and red give the window
an extraordinary richness. The best lights
from the glass are obtained in the early afternoon
about four o’clock. It is of rare richness and
beauty, and for subject, color, and arrangement
it is thought to be unexcelled in our country.
There are twenty-seven panels, each of which contains
an almost life-size figure representing one of
the chief militant figures in the Bible. Services
are held in the Chapel every Sunday morning
at a quarter before eleven and are attended by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
cadets, officers, enlisted men, their families, and a
large number of visitors. In addition to the regular
service in the Chapel, where the cadet choir
of one hundred and five voices is a feature, a series
of organ recitals, free to the public, is given each
year.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_058" src="images/i_058.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">The Interior of the Chapel</p></div>

<p>The organ is of unusually fine quality and is
surprisingly effective for an instrument of three
manuals, or keyboards. But it is still incomplete,
being both undersized for this cathedral-like
building and inadequate to the proper performance
of the finest music. The addition of a fourth
manual, with its pipes located in the gallery opposite
the present organ, now eloquently vacant,
is needed to bring the musical part of the service
and the recitals up to the highest efficiency.</p>

<p>Upon the completion of the improvements
contemplated the organ will become one of the
art glories of the country, and with the Chapel,&mdash;perfect
in architecture, surroundings, and acoustics&mdash;would
create an atmosphere of rare idealism.
The acquisition of every new stop given is
indicated by a bronze tablet placed upon the console,
or key desk, of the organ. The significance
of such tablets would make this organ and console
unique, not only in establishing historic
traditions but also in affording substantial encouragement
to the volunteer organist and to the
choir.</p>

<p>The opportunity here presented is most worthy
for anyone desirous of establishing a memorial
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
to a graduate of the Academy, for a graduate
wishing to honor the memory of one of his immediate
family, for a class gift, or for anyone interested
in furthering an artistic influence over the
lives of the future officers of the Army of our
country.</p>

<p>To assist in the completion of the organ, a fund,
known as the “Organ Fund” has been started,
which is kept alive by recital offerings, private
subscriptions, and proceeds from sale of “The
Corps,” a popular West Point song.</p>

<p>In the transepts are galleries but they are not
at present equipped with seats. Along the nave
also are covered galleries, almost hidden from
view by the suspended flags.</p>

<p>A request made to the sexton will enable the
visitor to see the crypt, a vaulted room beneath
the Chapel that is designed to be the final resting
place of West Point’s illustrious military dead.</p>

<p>To care for the spiritual welfare of the cadets
and other residents of the Post, there is a Chaplain
who is appointed by the President. His term
of office is for four years, but he is usually re-appointed.</p>

<p>The location of the Chapel makes it visible from
many places on the Post. In walking around the
grounds, every once in a while an extraordinarily
effective view of the fine building strikes the
beholder. Each glimpse seems more beautiful
than the previous one, and a general impression
remains that the Chapel holds a spiritual dominion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
over the institution. Every corner of the
main part of West Point seems under its influence.
This feeling is particularly strong as we
stand on the sidewalk between the old and new
Cadet Barracks and gaze at this monumental
pile of ethereal beauty that seems to lose itself
in the sky. I never view the Chapel from this
point without thinking of one of Maxfield Parrish’s
imaginative paintings of the Arabian Nights.</p>

<p>In the southwest angle of the Plain, from where
I like to view the Chapel, is a white granite statue
of Major Sylvanus Thayer, class of 1808. The
funds for this modest but beautiful monument,
which was unveiled June 11, 1883, were contributed
by loyal graduates of the Academy and
by loving friends. General Thayer was Superintendent
of the Academy from 1817 to 1833.
He was the first to establish a real curriculum,
and so valuable were his services that he has
since been called “the Father of the Academy.”
The body of the distinguished officer was brought
from South Braintree, Mass., and reinterred in
the Post cemetery on November 8, 1877. The
sculptor of the monument was Carl Conrad.</p>

<p>On the west side of the Plain is the North
Cadet Barracks, one of the new buildings completed
in 1908. The Gothic style employed in
the treatment of this building, while resembling
somewhat that of the old barracks, has more
dignity, beauty, and grace. Not enough difference
exists between the two to cause any lack of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
harmony. Chief among the changes made in
the new barracks are the windows which are triple
instead of single. As far as the interior is concerned
the arrangement is identical. Modern
plumbing has been installed in the old barracks
to conform to its new neighbor, so that the cadets
of today are no longer obliged to run down to
the area to draw their water from the hydrant.
The very mention of this ancient and picturesque
custom brings back many memories, chiefly centered
around reveille on a bitterly cold morning.
Immediately upon the dismissal of the ranks,
hordes of cadets (it seemed to me), clustered
around one poor little hydrant from which a
thin stream of icy water trickled into the <i>papier
maché</i> buckets. Now, upon each floor of barracks
are faucets with hot and cold water! I wish that
I were a cadet again!</p>

<p>No one would judge the building to be a military
barracks. Rather, a study of its lines would
suggest that it was the home of some religious
order. It has an undeniable ecclesiastical character
that impresses one immediately. I have
always derived great pleasure in contemplating
its beauty and my imagination at these times
fancies it as the refuge, the shelter, the sanctuary
of a body of men separated from the material
affairs of the world. It seems made to house
only the best and noblest in nature, to be the
environment from which high ideals receive their
greatest inspiration. A group of happy smiling
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
cadets coming out of their rooms at this moment
tells me that my imagination has been dwelling
upon reality and not wandering into fantastic
fields. This building is indeed the home of a
splendid Order, the inspiring order of young
manhood, clean-minded and honorable, trained
in a school where they are taught the most scrupulous
regard for the truth, and where they are
given a <i>mens sana in corpore sano</i>.</p>

<p>In the quadrangle the light brick facing gives,
in all sorts of weather, a bright cheerful aspect,
a sunny appearance, that contrasts in a most
welcome manner with the gloom of the quadrangle
of the old barracks.</p>

<p>Set well back from the Plain, and to the north
of the new barracks, is the Gymnasium. It is
not built of granite like its neighbor, the new
barracks, but has received from the hands of the
architect an artistic and interesting treatment of
brick and limestone. The broad wall-like surface
of the front is broken by six flat buttresses,
whose terminals are richly decorated. Viewing
the building from the southeast corner these
buttresses appear like giant sentinels, fine specimens
of the building’s physical development.
Far across the parade ground the Bachelor
Officers’ quarters, of similar design, serves with the
Gymnasium to link in one harmonious whole the
old and new buildings surrounding the Plain.</p>

<p>The second story is devoted to the gymnasium
proper. It is lighted by large skylights, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
equipped with every possible device for physical
development. The remainder of the building
houses a fine natatorium, 77 feet wide and 92
feet long, with a swimming-pool 40 feet wide and
80 feet long; a fencing-room, a boxing-room, a
wrestling-room, besides the necessary dressing-rooms
for both cadets and officers. In the basement
is a shooting gallery for indoor rifle and
pistol practice.</p>

<p>North of the Gymnasium and fronting the Plain,
are the quarters of the Superintendent of the
Academy, an interesting old house that dates
from 1820. Surrounding the house is a quaint
old ironwork porch of later date, but old enough
to be a curiosity today. A well-proportioned
central hall gives access to charming suites of
spacious rooms on both sides of the quarters,
but the suite on the left is the more beautiful
for it offers a fascinating vista of three large
rooms terminating in a conservatory filled with
exotic plants. Delightful hospitality has been
dispensed in these rooms to some of the most
noted people in the world. Royalty, distinguished
foreigners, civilians, and soldiers, noted American
men and women are constantly visiting West
Point to inspect the school and are always entertained
by the Superintendent. If the walls of
these quarters could speak they would relate some
interesting incidents of the official life of West
Point. The beauty of the rooms is today enhanced
by a number of fine family portraits,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
painted by Thomas Sully, and the property of
the present Superintendent, Colonel John Biddle,
Corps of Engineers.</p>

<p>At any official function the guests usually
crowd the fascinating old porch to watch the
evolutions of the cadets upon the Plain opposite,
or sometimes they indulgently stand on the front
stone steps to pose for the breathlessly impatient
movie men and photographers. The quarters
are surrounded by beautiful, well-kept lawns and
tall graceful elm trees.</p>

<p>A traveler may go far before he will behold so
majestic a view as that of the Hudson River from
Trophy Point and Battle Monument. For pure
beauty it is unsurpassed. In the distance lies
the city of Newburg, against a dim background
of the Shawangunk Mountains, and in the foreground
the little village of Coldspring nestles
close to the side of rugged Breakneck. On the
opposite side Cro’s Nest descends abruptly to
the water. At this spot the Hudson seems to
be surrounded on all sides by land so that the
beholder might well imagine himself in Europe
among the Italian Lakes.</p>

<p>Upon this spot are a number of trophies, among
the most interesting of which is a portion of the
old chain that, during the Revolutionary War,
was stretched across the river from just above
Gee’s Point to Constitution Island to prevent
the passage of the British ships.</p>

<p>On a wooden carriage is a large Armstrong
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
gun, captured at Fort Fisher during the Civil
War, and nearby are many other guns taken in
the Mexican and Spanish Wars. The Swartzkopf
torpedo inclosed in an iron railing was captured
from the Spanish cruiser <i>Viscaya</i> in the war with
Spain, and the twenty-pound stone ball was
brought from Smyrna, Turkey.</p>

<p>The polished monolith of granite nearby upon
whose tip stands winged “Fame,” poised with
trumpet and outstretched wreath, is Battle Monument.
The names which may be read upon its
rolls are the victims of the Regular Army of 1861,
to whose memory their comrades in arms have
created this beautiful memorial.</p>

<h3>
IN MEMORY<br />
OF THE<br />
OFFICERS AND MEN<br />
OF THE<br />
REGULAR ARMY OF THE UNITED STATES<br />
WHO FELL IN BATTLE DURING THE<br />
WAR OF THE REBELLION<br />
THIS MONUMENT IS ERECTED BY THEIR<br />
SURVIVING COMRADES<br />
</h3>

<p>In the words of the late Colonel Larned, “this
memorial was not built by a grateful country,
but by voluntary offerings from the hard-won pay
of comrades in the field within hearing of the roar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
of battle, and in sight of the dead whose memory
it preserves.... It is but right to add that the
designer, Stanford White, and the sculptor, Frederick
MacMonnies, have given a generous and
enthusiastic labor to the work, far beyond the
money recompense received, and in the true spirit
of the artist and patriotic citizen.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_066" src="images/i_066.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">View up the Hudson River from Trophy Point</p></div>

<p>Toward the east is an equestrian bronze statue
of the Father of our Country, seated upon his
charger and with hand raised toward the Academy
buildings as if in benediction of the institution
that he labored so hard to establish. In these
days of materialism, it is interesting to note that
this magnificent gift was recently made to the
Academy by someone who refused to disclose
his name. The base of the pedestal bears the
simple inscription “Presented by a Patriotic
Citizen.”</p>

<p>The hotel, just in the rear of the Washington
Monument, was built in 1829, and with the exception
of a wing that was added in 1850, it has
remained practically unchanged. It is not difficult
to imagine, therefore, that its appointments
fail to satisfy the luxurious tastes of present-day
Americans, so that many complaints are heard,
and not a few jokes passed at its expense. One
humorist remarked that Washington was raising
his hand not in benediction of the Academy, but
in a warning to the guests to keep away from the
hotel.</p>

<p>From the hotel, a steep little graveled path entices
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
the visitor into a most enchanting walk
that skirts the steep precipice along the river.
For three-quarters of a mile, Flirtation Walk pursues
its way with its windings and abrupt turnings,
its ascents and descents, past the site of
the old chain Battery, and farther on past old
Lantern Battery on Gee’s Point, past the Bachelor
Officers’ quarters, until at the base of Cullum Hall
it ends in Kosciusko’s Garden. The latter is a
cool little sheltered plateau, said to have been a
favorite of the Pole. When the trees are in bloom,
to stroll along the Walk is to feel the delicacy of
nature, to behold the quintessence of her refinement.
The foliage seems like maiden-hair fern
through which charming little vistas of the river
and the opposite bank are framed. On summer
days it is a favorite for the cadets and their girls,
who wander along its graveled path whiling away
the time, or who seek out the choice nooks and
screen themselves from profane eyes with a gaily
colored parasol.</p>

<p>Near the end of Flirtation Walk alongside of
old Battery Knox, a Revolutionary relic, stands
the Bachelor Officers’ quarters. This building of
brick and limestone, serves to tie the new buildings
with the classic Cullum Memorial Hall and the
Officers’ Mess. Its color is darker than the pink
granite of Cullum Hall, to approach more closely
the dark brown of the Library and the gray of the
Academic, while its flat buttresses harmonize with
the straight lines of Memorial Hall.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="author">
<i>Photo White Studio</i></p>

<p class="caption">“Spooning” on Flirtation Walk
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span></p></div>

<p>In this building there are forty suites of three
rooms and a bath each, besides rooms in the basement
for the janitor and for officers’ servants.</p>

<p>Adjoining the Bachelor Officers’ quarters is the
beautiful Cullum Memorial Hall, built of Milford
pink marble and resembling somewhat in style, the
Erechtheum, on the Acropolis at Athens. Just
under the cornice and above the four Ionic columns
is carved: “To the Officers and Graduates of the
Military Academy.” To the left of the main hall
is a small assembly room, whose walls contain
bronze tablets to graduates who have been killed
in action. The flags are guidons, carried by our
Cavalry, both regular and volunteer, during our
wars, chiefly during the Spanish War.</p>

<p>In the lower halls are tablets to Superintendents
and to the deceased Professors of the Academy,
besides fitting bronze memorial shields, recounting
the battles of the Civil War in which graduates of
the Academy participated.</p>

<p>Bronze trophy cannon are freely used in the
adornment of the walls, both in the lower hall and
in the hall on the second floor. They are chiefly
Mexican and Confederate trophies, but a few
were captured from the British at Stony Point
(south of West Point) in July, 1779.</p>

<p>Among the most interesting perhaps of the
cannon are the two large bronze ones in front of
the main entrance. Both were made at Douay,
France, in 1755, under the supervision of J.
Béranger, royal commissioner of foundaries. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
one on the right (as one enters the building) is
inscribed “Le Fâcheux,” and the one on the left
“Le Conquérant.” Both were taken from the
Punta Blanca Battery in the harbor of Santiago
de Cuba. These cannon are almost the exact
duplicate of the five cannon at the United States
Naval Academy, Annapolis, Md., and very similar
to two cannon at the Virginia Military Institute,
Lexington, Va. The latter guns, cast about
eighty years before the others, are part of several
cannon purchased from France by Virginia in
1778 for use in the Revolutionary War. It is
surprising that the Spanish should have been using
them in Cuba, since the Spaniards manufactured
guns of equally high quality.</p>

<p>The four inverted bronze mortars that surmount
the corners of the piazza were made, two at
Sevilla and two at Barcelona, in Spain, and were
surrendered by the Mexicans to the American
forces, April 22, 1847. These mortars were known
as stone mortars, and they were employed in siege
operations to precipitate large masses of stone
upon the heads of the enemy in the advanced
trenches, or in like manner to clear the trench of its
defenders preparatory to an assault.</p>

<p>The second floor is called Thayer Hall, a large,
beautifully proportioned room used for public
functions, officers’ and cadets’ dances. At one end
there is a small stage and a few scenic fixtures.
In this hall are the portraits of graduates who have
not only gained the rank of general officer, but have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
commanded <i>in time of war</i> units commensurate
with their rank.</p>

<p>The building south of Memorial Hall is the
Officers’ Mess, where the bachelor officers obtain
their meals. The building was constructed and
partially furnished from Government funds, but
it is kept up and managed by personal funds of
officers on duty at West Point. In design it
conforms closely to Cullum Hall, although plainer
and more modest. It was so built as to be inconspicuous
and not detract from the classic beauty
of its stately neighbor.</p>

<p>The interior of the Mess is quite beautiful,
especially the main dining-hall and reading-room,
whose principal features are mantels ornamented
with small replicas of the figures of Day and Night,
Morning and Evening, that adorn the tomb of the
Medicis in Florence. Both Cullum Hall and the
Mess were designed by the late Stanford White and
completed, the former in 1899 and the latter in
1903. The Mess is an organized body incorporated
under the laws of the State of New York as
the West Point Army Mess. It was started in 1841
by General McClellan. There is no Mess in our
Army that has had a continued existence for so
long a term as this Mess, and I have heard it
stated that few English or continental Messes are
as old in the above sense.</p>

<p>The trip around the buildings brings us to the
Library for which we all entertain a genuine
affection. The quiet and repose of its fine rooms
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
have an attraction for both officers and cadets
that no other building offers, so that it is usually
filled with lovers of books, especially on winter
afternoons. Cadets, officers, enlisted men, women,
and children frequent the various rooms whenever
an opportunity presents itself. There is no
greater pleasure, I believe, at West Point than
to draw a big leather armchair over in one corner
of the library and there forget the world in a good
book.</p>

<p>Like so many of the buildings at West Point
it was built of native granite, and in the Gothic
style of architecture. The present building was
erected in 1841 on the site of the old gun shed and
cost approximately $50,000. It was, however,
entirely remodeled in 1900-1901. The Library
was originally designed by a board of Army
officers and the style of architecture determined
upon was used seven years later in the present
South Cadet Barracks. The dominant note that
these two buildings gave to the character of the
structures at West Point, determined the style of
architecture in the comprehensive rebuilding of the
Academy that began in 1904.</p>

<p>The library proper was founded in 1812, and
with the years has grown until at the present time
it contains 99,148 books. I am informed that the
100,000 mark will be celebrated by the purchase of
a memorable volume. The Library may be said
to be the oldest inhabitant of the neighborhood,
for all its former associates, the old Riding Hall,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
the Cavalry Barracks, and the old Cadet Chapel
are gone.</p>

<p>The latter building, however, has not permanently
disappeared. Sentiment against its demolition
was so strong that an appropriation was
obtained to remove it to the cemetery to be
used as a mortuary chapel. Consequently in 1911
it was taken down, each stone marked, and so
carefully reconstructed that it is impossible to
detect the slightest change in its appearance.
The tablets, and the painting of “Peace and War”
by the late Professor Weir have been preserved,
but the British flags have been removed to the
Ordnance Museum.</p>

<p>The cemetery is a beautiful, peaceful spot set
aside for the repose of West Point’s dead. In the
northeast angle is the cadet monument erected in
1818, to Cadet Vincent M. Lowe of New York,
by his fellow-cadets. On New Year’s day, 1817,
Cadet Lowe was killed by the premature discharge
of a cannon while he was firing a salute. The pedestal
is covered with the names of other cadets
who died later on. Among the illustrious dead
buried in the cemetery are Major Sylvanus Thayer,
General Winfield Scott, Robert Anderson, and
George A. Custer.</p>

<p>Along the main roads both north and south of
the Plain are modest dwellings furnished for the
officers on duty at West Point. The south end
terminates in a broad plain used for the Cavalry
and Field Artillery drill of the cadets.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span></p>

<p>In order that thorough instruction in both of
these arms may be imparted to the cadets, detachments
of Cavalry and Field Artillery are stationed
at the Academy. Their barracks and stables
form part of the new buildings, and are fine
examples of what intelligence and taste can do for
comfort and convenience. Along the west side of
the drill field are the stables and, directly above,
gracefully placed on the hillside, are the barracks
provided with the best and most modern equipment.
The presence of these two detachments of
enlisted men, as well as that of the detachment of
Engineers, is absolutely essential to the efficient
instruction of the cadets.</p>

<p>An understanding of the uses of the buildings
and some description of the prominent landmarks
is necessary to a correct appreciation of the
cadet’s life and activities. The survey that I
have given in this chapter will show that West
Point is indeed fortunate in many ways. Few
places have been so endowed by Nature with such
wonderful beauty and picturesqueness, and, in
addition, a generous Congress has adorned the
place with magnificent buildings equipped with
the finest that money can buy for the training of
the future United States officers.

<span class="large">THE POWERS THAT BE</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">In</span> a spacious room in the southeast corner of the
massive Post Headquarters building dwells
officially the man who orders all of the comings and
goings of the residents of West Point: cadets,
officers, and enlisted men and their families. He is
detailed by the President to the immediate government
and military command of the Academy and
Post of West Point for a period of four years, and
given the official title of Superintendent of the
Military Academy, which carries with it the rank,
pay, and allowances of a colonel.</p>

<p>The duties of the office are varied and complex.
The Superintendent is directly responsible for the
actual state of the discipline, instruction, police
administration, fiscal affairs, and other concerns
of the Academy. The necessary work is organized
and under the control of various officers,
his assistants, who constitute his staff. The office
of Superintendent is regarded as one of
the most desirable and most honored that the
Government has to offer to an officer of the
Army, and justly so, for the position carries
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
with it a great responsibility, fascinating work,
large powers, and enormous prestige. The President
is in no way limited in his selection for the
office. He may appoint an officer of any rank
whatsoever, from second lieutenant to general
officer, but the policy always pursued has been
to intrust the important duties of the position to
an officer of character, ability, and experience.
The selection of the Superintendents of the Military
Academy was confined to the Corps of Engineers
from the establishment of the institution,
March 16, 1802, till the passage of the law of
July 13, 1866, which opened it to the entire Army.
It is not an easy task to find just the man with
all of the necessary requirements for this office.
In addition to the officer’s military ability, grasp
of affairs, and experience, it is desirable that his
scholarly attainments be of a distinctly high order,
for, since he is <i>ex-officio</i> the President of the
Academic Board, he will find occasion to use his
scholarship for the permanent benefit of the curriculum.</p>

<p>In general, the military demands upon the average
officer’s time preclude the pursuit, on his
part, of cultural and academic studies to any great
degree, so that, while an officer may be of the
highest moral character, have great experience,
and on the whole make an admirable administrative
chief, yet he might lack scholarship, which
deficiency would lessen his value to the Academy
as Superintendent.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span></p>

<p>Besides, the Superintendent should be a good
judge of human nature, and in particular of young
men. To be able to throw oneself back in memory
to the age of twenty, re-grasp the fresh and
immature viewpoint of youth, and then make the
proper allowances for youth’s inability to see life
as a whole, is a gift not given to many men. Some
of us could do it if we would exert our minds, but
many are incapable. Where sympathy and understanding
of young men are lacking on the part of
the commanding officer there is too often a tendency
to judge a cadet by the standard held by his
superiors which they have gained only through
years of experience. Moreover, a broad man
in command dissipates with a word all of the
trivialities of military life that seem big for
the moment, and relieves his subordinates of the
haunting fear of an excess of participation in their
affairs.</p>

<p>During the one hundred and fifteen years of
its existence West Point has had but twenty-six
Superintendents, each of whom has left a permanent
influence for good at the Academy. The
present incumbent, appointed in June, 1916,
is Colonel John Biddle, Corps of Engineers, a
graduate of West Point, Class of 1881.</p>

<p>The military staff of the Superintendent consists
of the Adjutant, the Quartermaster, the Treasurer,
and the Surgeon, all officers of the Army detailed
to perform the duties of their respective offices.</p>

<p>The Adjutant is the Superintendent’s right-hand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
man. He is in fact his chief spokesman and
representative in all official and social matters.
He is, moreover, charged with all of the records
and papers of the Academy except those relating
to disbursements. Ordinarily, this officer is the
personal choice of the Superintendent, for it is
essential that perfect trust and harmony exist
between these officers. It may be of interest to
the layman to know that an Army Post is very
much like a large family, or perhaps a patriarchal
tribe would better describe the relations of
the residents. The Superintendent is the head,
and the Adjutant his executive officer.</p>

<p>In the olden days when troops were stationed
on isolated frontier posts, the officers’ families
were entirely thrown upon one another for society.
Although the necessity for these posts has long
since disappeared, Congress has never authorized
their abandonment, because their presence near
some city or small town means a financial benefit
to the towns people. The influence of the Representative
of that district is sufficient to retain it,
and consequently, as of yore, officers’ families must
live together as one tribe.</p>

<p>This condition does not exist to the same extent
at West Point as at other posts. The Adjutant
is the peacemaker, diplomat, aide, buffer for the
Superintendent in his administration of military
and social duties. As may be imagined, he must
be a man of great tact, good judgment, and
possessed of Machiavelian diplomacy. He is always
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
being called upon to make decisions, and
since every decision affects somebody adversely, he
has great need of a feeling for humanity. His
official decision is tantamount to that of the Superintendent
in whose name he is always supposed
to act.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_078" src="images/i_078.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">The Superintendent’s Quarters<br />
Built in 1820</p></div>

<p>All official letters to the Superintendent, or
between officers, must pass over the Adjutant’s
desk, so that in a sense he is the central operator,
making connections of the invisible ties for the
time being, between the various departments and
persons on the Post. He also acts as a shield to
the Superintendent, saving him from the annoyance
of the minor routine details.</p>

<p>In addition, he is regarded as the hub of the
Post’s social wheel. He initiates the public
entertainments and authorizes the general social
events of the officers and cadets. Naturally, he
has nothing to do with functions of a private character,
but for hops, dances, or other forms of distraction
where one of the public buildings is used,
he gives the authorization of the Superintendent.
He makes it his duty to mingle freely with the
officers of the command; at the dances he sees that
visitors are introduced; when <i>very</i> distinguished
guests arrive at the Post, he puts on his full-dress
uniform and goes to the station to meet them. If
the guests are merely distinguished, he details
some officer to act in his stead, and if they are plain
sightseers with letters of introduction, a young
subaltern gets the job. He is Adjutant of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
Military Academy and of the Post of West Point.
The duties of the former office pertain solely to
cadets, their discipline and instruction, whereas
the duties of the latter concern the officers, enlisted
men, and other residents of the Post.</p>

<p>A sort of Damon and Pythias are the Adjutant
and Quartermaster: a mention of one suggests
the other. The Quartermaster is in charge of the
public lands and buildings; of the material for the
erection of buildings, and for the repairs and improvements,
and for all other public property for
which no other person is especially responsible.
Under the direction of the Superintendent, he
enters into contracts and makes purchases for the
Academy and prepares all accounts, returns, and
rolls relative to the public property under his
charge. He is also in control of the workmen
employed in the erection or repairs of the public
buildings, or in the improvement of the grounds.</p>

<p>A Quartermaster is in reality a supply officer.
Everything necessary for the up-keep of the Post
and the command, come from his storehouses.
Clothes, trucks, wagons, frying-pans, rakes, road-rollers,
twine, furniture, garden hose are a few of
the diverse articles that he must keep on hand.
In his work at West Point he is assisted by several
officers, among whom he distributes the various
duties pertaining to the care of the property, purchase
of supplies, pay of officers and enlisted men.
The supply of the cadets, however, is not under
his jurisdiction.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_080" src="images/i_080.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Colonel John Biddle, Corps of Engineers<br />
Superintendent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span></p></div>

<p>The Quartermaster’s office is not entirely free
from the official cumbersome machinery and red
tape that clogs all Government branches. So
efficiently does it check up upon all of its property,
even to the most minute screw, that it has inspired
great respect for its routine into those who borrow
from its storehouse. Some years ago, one of
the officers’ wives discovered the chimney of her
house on fire. As she lived near the Hospital
her first thought was to borrow one of the fire extinguishers.
She rushed to the telephone:</p>

<p>“Hello! Hello! send over right away a fire
extinguisher to Lieut. K’s quarters!”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, madam,” replied the attendant, “I
have no authority to let the fire extinguisher leave
the Hospital.”</p>

<p>“But my house is on fire!” shrieked the angered
lady! “What shall I do?”</p>

<p>“You had better telephone the Quartermaster,
madam, and get his permission, for the Hospital
holds the fire extinguisher on memorandum
receipt.”</p>

<p>All matters that relate to the clothing, equipment,
and subsistence of the cadets, including the
purveying and supervision of the Cadet Mess, are
under an officer of the Army detailed as Quartermaster
and Commissary for the Corps of Cadets and
Treasurer of the United States Military Academy.</p>

<p>The Government allows each cadet $600 per year
and one ration per day, or commutation thereof,
40 cents per day, making a total of $746.00, but the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
cadet never receives in cash nor manages, his pay.
The amount due him is turned over to the Treasurer,
who keeps an account with each cadet in which
he credits him with his monthly pay and charges
him with the cost of his maintenance on a pro-rata
basis plus what he has spent for clothing and supplies.
The Treasurer furnishes each cadet an
itemized statement of his account at the close of
each settlement period so that he knows just how
much money he has saved, or owes. The pay provided
is ample. Cadets who are economical and
take good care of their clothes, who lose no government
property for which they are responsible, are
able to accumulate a nice balance that is paid to
them upon graduation.</p>

<p>In order, however, to insure that all cadets shall
leave the Academy without debts, and with their
initial equipment paid for, the Treasurer deposits
fourteen dollars per month from the pay of each
cadet. This fund is known as the Equipment
Fund and totals $704 during the four years. Before
graduation each cadet is required to submit
a certificate to the effect, if such be the case, that
all articles of an officer’s uniform ordered and
received by him have been paid for; that, in case
the complete outfit has not been received and paid
for, he has in his possession $475 or that amount
less whatever has been paid out for this purpose,
which sum will be held and applied promptly to the
payment of such articles of his uniform and equipment
as have not yet been received and paid for;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
and that he has no unpaid debts contracted during
the time he has been a cadet.</p>

<p>This provision is a very wise and beneficial one
to the cadet, for he enters the Service free from
the terrifying load of debt. Formerly the Equipment
Fund was turned over to the graduating
cadet, without any restrictions whatsoever. The
consequence was that the largest part of it was
spent in New York a few days after graduation,
and the young officer was in debt for his uniform
for many months thereafter. He started his
career with a millstone around his neck, to which
weight a few added that of a wife. As one experienced
officer remarked, “The ladies are all right,
but do not marry until you are out of debt, else
every time you take a drink in the Club, you will
feel as if you are swallowing the baby’s socks.”</p>

<p>One of the most important and difficult duties
of the Treasurer is catering to eight hundred
ravenous young appetites. To be a successful
Mess officer for this large number requires much
study, especially in this age of the high cost of
supplies. The food provided is excellent in quality
and well prepared. In general it is plain and
wholesome, just what one would expect at a
Military School, but the menu is sufficiently
varied so as to please even the fastidious. Southern
palates are not forced to long for fried chicken
nor Eastern palates for oysters. To make the
New Englander feel quite at home periodic boiled
dinners gladden their gastronomic lives. Then,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
too, ice-cream, since the installation of an electric
freezer, has become as common as the proteids.</p>

<p>The monthly cost of the mess per cadet is about
twenty dollars. The Treasurer charges against
the cadet not only the cost of his board, but also
his laundry, his uniforms, his clothing, his room
equipment, mattress, pillows, sheets, towels, and
all other necessary articles. Moreover, the salaries
of the policemen who clean the halls of the
barracks, the bootblacks, the cost of the cadet
hops, athletics, and text-books, in fact, the cadet’s
entire maintenance is charged against his pay.
The Government, however, provides for the up-keep
of the buildings, the heating, lighting, and
repairs, from separate appropriations.</p>

<p>The fourth member of the military staff is the
Surgeon, who with his four assistants, medical
officers of the Army, watch over the health of the
command. Under his charge is the hospital for
cadets, and that for enlisted men.</p>

<p>The Surgeon has authority to excuse an officer
or cadet from any duty whatsoever on account of
illness. In the eyes of the cadets he stands as the
guardian of the Gates of Paradise. When the
body is fatigued, or one’s head is choked up and
eyes running from a bad cold, illnesses that in
reality do not incapacitate one for duty, to have a
nice sympathetic Dr. St. Peter jingle his keys and
take you into the hospital for a brief rest is like the
first whiff of a jasmine scented spring. The cadets
soon learn to estimate the sympathetic qualities
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
of a new Surgeon, and quickly pass around the
word whether there has commenced the reign of an
adamantine or tender Æsculapius.</p>

<p>The officers and cadets are required to undergo
an annual physical examination, of which accurate
records are kept. In case of illness, the nature is
noted on special cards and filed with his record
in Washington. The health, therefore, of officers,
cadets, and enlisted men is constantly under the
Surgeon’s eyes, so that really serious illnesses are
rare. In case of persistent or long illness, the officer
or cadet may be granted a sick leave upon the
Surgeon’s recommendation.</p>

<p>The conduct of the business methods and military
departments of the Military Academy, by the
Superintendent and his staff, is annually inspected
by the Inspector-General of the Army, who comes
on from Washington for the purpose, or by officers
recommended by him acting under specific instructions
from the War Department. In addition to the
above inspection, a Board of Visitors annually visits
the institution. Formerly, the President appointed
to this Board distinguished citizens from all parts
of the country, who arrived at West Point the first
of June and remained until graduation, about ten
days later. They were shown the workings of the
school, and had explained to them the necessities
for changes and improvements, whereupon they
made to the President a written report containing
comments and recommendations that seemed desirable.
The Board performed its duties well, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
Congress thought that all information, upon which
appropriations are based, should be more direct.
A law was passed therefore decreeing that:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Board of Visitors to the United States Military
Academy shall consist of five members of the Committee
on Military Affairs of the Senate, and seven
members of the Committee on Military Affairs of the
House of Representatives, to be appointed by the
respective chairmen thereof, who shall annually
visit the said Military Academy, together or separately
as the said committee may elect, during the
session of Congress; ... It shall be the duty of the
Board of Visitors to inquire into the actual state of
the discipline, instruction, police administration, fiscal
affairs, and other concerns of the Academy.</p></blockquote>

<p>With the passing of the visits in June of the
former Board, some of the picturesqueness and
flavor of the social life of June week has gone. At
this season of the year the beautiful natural
scenery of West Point formed a superb setting for
the thrilling artillery drills, the cavalry charges, the
infantry manœuvres, the bridge building, the concerts,
the dances arranged in their honor. The
cadets were at their best for they had just completed
their spring training and there were no
recruits in ranks to spoil the smoothness and precision
of these manœuvres. It therefore seemed
the best time for an Inspection Board to view
and report upon the work.</p>

<p>Accompanying the Board of Visitors were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
always the wives and daughters of the members,
who added to the social charm of the Board’s
visit. The cadets privately referred to the young
ladies attached to the Board as “splinters.” I
remember, upon entrance, hearing one cadet
ask another if he would “drag a splinter” for him.
I later found out that this expression meant that
he would be pleased if his comrade would escort
one of the young ladies to a dance. The present
Board usually pays its visit in mid-winter when
the cadets are busiest with their studies, so that
the equally charming Congressional “splinters”
have little chance to win young hearts.</p>

<p>In the work of the institution the Superintendent
is aided by a large number of subordinates. The
number of officers and others in prominent positions
on duty at the Academy is shown in the

<p>The majority of the officers are detailed from
the Army-at-large for varying periods of time, but
seven of the professors are permanent. The Superintendent,
the heads of all Departments of Instruction,
including the detailed heads, compose
the Academic Board, which controls the program
and methods of instruction. It is non-military
in character, its duties pertaining almost solely to
the various branches of learning. More especially,
its duties are to examine cadets, decide upon their
merits and proficiency, grant diplomas, and recommend
for commission in the Army. It reports,
through the Superintendent, to the War Department,
on the course of studies and methods of
instruction. It also recommends the text-books
to be used by the cadets in each department.
Each member has one vote, including the Superintendent.</p>

<p>The work of the Board is largely done by committees,
both General Committees and Class
Committees. The latter are composed of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
heads of those departments whose studies any one
class are pursuing.</p>

<p>At the close of every examination the Academic
Board reports to the War Department the names
of all cadets who are deficient in studies or conduct
and who are recommended by the Board for discharge
or transfer to a lower class.</p>

<p>The seven professors permanently attached
to the Academy are: the Professor of Civil and
Military Engineering, Natural and Experimental
Philosophy, Chemistry and Electricity, Modern
Languages, Mathematics, Drawing, and English
and History. These members are appointed by
the President and usually selected from officers of
the Army, graduates of the Academy, who have
specialized along the lines of their department.
The President usually appoints an officer recommended
by the other members of the Board, but he
is not restricted in his choice and may select whom
he pleases for the position. All of the permanent
Professors at present are graduates except the
Professor of English and History who is a graduate
of Yale. When the Department of English was
created in 1910, it was felt that the head of it
should be a man who had specialized in English
Literature.</p>

<p>Without reflecting on the graduates of the
Academy, no one officer appeared upon the horizon
with the requisite qualifications, a fact not to be
wondered at, for few officers are ever in a position
to pursue English courses that would equip them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
for this position. Upon the creation of the
Department of English, History was transferred to
this Department from the Department of Law
with which it had long been associated.</p>

<p>In addition to the permanent members of the
Board, the detailed ones are the Surgeon, who
as the head of the Department of Hygiene, is entitled
to a seat; the Professor of Practical Military
Engineering, the Professor of Law, the Professor
of Ordnance and Gunnery, and the Commandant
of Cadets, all four of whom are detailed by the
Secretary of War from the officers of the Army
for a period of four years.</p>

<p>In the Department of Mathematics and Modern
Languages the Professor has an associate professor
and an assistant professor whose duty is to assist
in the administrative work as well as the instruction.
The other departments have only assistant
professors, officers detailed from the Army who
might be said to act as an Adjutant for the Professor.
In common with the remaining officers,
they perform administrative routine duties, relieving
the Professor of the necessity of attending to
minor questions. The Professor’s time is very
much occupied in the solution of problems that
affect the Academy as a whole, in addition to the
development of their respective courses, so that it
is essential that his time be not employed with the
unavoidable trivialities that arise in the conduct
of his Department.</p>

<p>The great mass of officers on duty at the Academy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
are, of course, the instructors. These men
are all officers of the Army, graduates of the
Academy, who are detailed for duty in the various
departments. Formerly, the tour of duty was for
four years, but since the passage of a law by
Congress, the Detached Service Law, familiarly
called the “Manchu Law,” the time that an
instructor can remain on duty at West Point, is
dependent upon the amount of duty that he has
had with troops during the preceding six years.
No officer can remain on detached service, such as
that at West Point, for more than four years.</p>

<p>It is apparent, therefore, that the corps of
instructors is constantly changing, resulting in the
introduction into the work of new blood and fresh
viewpoints. This changing of instructors maintains
a high standard of enthusiasm for teaching,
so often lacking in institutions of learning where a
subordinate teacher goes over, year in and year
out, the same ground.</p>

<p>Moreover, the system of officer instructors is
employed on account of the disciplinary value of
their presence over the cadets. West Point is
first and foremost a Military Academy, and it is of
primary importance that the cadets shall absorb
by example the spirit of discipline, and military
deportment. Not the least of the advantages of
having officers teach cadets is the contact that
their presence maintains between West Point
and the Army.</p>

<p>Officers are selected for duty at the Academy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
by the Heads of Departments who make every
effort to secure men especially qualified for the
work. For example, the instructors in the Department
of Engineering are all Engineer officers; in
Ordnance and Gunnery, mostly Ordnance officers;
in Chemistry and Electricity, usually Coast
Artillery officers; in Mathematics, officers of the
staff and line who excelled in this study as cadets;
in English and History, line officers with recognized
literary tendencies; in Languages, officers
whose advantages have enabled them to acquire
a good speaking knowledge of either French or
Spanish. Until the outbreak of the European
War, officers on duty in the Department of Languages
were ordered to spend the summer in study
in either France or Spain. They thereby were
able to perfect their knowledge to an extent that
rendered them most efficient instructors. Detailed
to this Department are two native Spaniards
and two Frenchmen, whose services are employed
to carry along the instruction of the officer instructors
as well as that of the cadets, so that
every opportunity is offered to the cadet to progress
as far as his ability will permit him in the
time allotted these studies.</p>

<p>The time of the officer is well employed while
on duty at the Academy. In those departments
whose period of recitation is an hour and a half,
he has two sections daily, but if the period is one
hour, he instructs three sections. He averages,
therefore, from fifteen to eighteen hours of actual
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
teaching per week. To this amount must be added
the conferences of the instructors, conducted either
by the Professor or one of his assistants. These
conferences are held, usually daily, and vary from
one to two hours and cover the material in the
lesson or in advance work. By means of these
conferences, the Professor is able to standardize
the teaching without restricting the personality or
individuality of his officers.</p>

<p>The routine work, that is, the keeping of records,
weekly reports, the correcting of exercises, problems,
and compositions, all demand a greater or less
amount of time, and then what is most important,
the instructor must spend many hours in preparation.
I have known many instructors to work
every night until midnight after the routine work
of the day.</p>

<p>In the demand upon an officer’s time, consideration
is given the fact that with him teaching is an
incident in his career, and he must therefore have
at his disposal, whether he uses it or not, at least
a couple of hours per day for professional work
and study. When absent from troops an officer
becomes more or less rusty upon the duties of his
arm, and he should, consequently, by reading, the
solution of problems, writing or what not, keep up
with the progress made in his branch of the
Service.</p>

<p>General Orders of the Army prescribe also that
at least one hour per day must be employed in
bodily exercise, riding, walking, tennis, golf,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
swimming, polo, etc., and the officer is required to
submit a certificate stating that he has taken the
prescribed amount.</p>

<p>I give in somewhat tedious detail the employment
of the officer’s time, because so frequently
I hear, expressed by the layman, the opinion that
officers of the Army have practically nothing to
do. It is ordinarily difficult to disabuse their
mind of this idea, chiefly because it is already
made up. A visitor arrives at West Point to spend
the day and seeing a few officers playing golf in
the morning he assumes that <i>all</i> officers have
nothing to do. He perhaps little realizes that the
same golfers, or tennis players, are trying to get
their exercise at a time that will not interfere with
their academic duties that begin for each department
at varying hours. That same officer, who
plays a game of golf at 9:30 <small>A.M.</small>, will in all
probability spend a part of the forenoon and
afternoon with the cadets, and all evening in preparation.
Appearances are often very deceptive.
This is particularly true in the Army, which has
been, until the war came upon us, subject to more
unjust criticism than any other professional body.</p>

<p>In order to facilitate the instruction, the cadets
are arranged in four distinct classes, corresponding
with the four years of study. The cadets in the
first year’s course constitute the Fourth Class,
those in the second year’s course, the Third
Class, those in the third year’s course the Second
Class, and those in the fourth year’s course the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
First Class. The designation of senior, junior,
sophomore, and freshman is not used at West
Point as in colleges and universities, but the terms
“Yearling” and “Plebe” are familiarly applied to
cadets of the third and fourth classes respectively.
The advancement of the cadets from one class to
another is based upon proficiency in their studies,
the details of which will be found in the chapter
on “The Discipline of the Mind.”</p>

<p>In order to distinguish the classes one from
another, the device of putting bands of braid on
the sleeve of the uniform has been adopted. These
lengths of mohair are called service stripes and are
issued one for each year of service, so that the
“plebe” sleeve is bare, the “yearling” has a single
stripe, the second classmen, two stripes, the first
classmen, three stripes. This insignia is of black
braid for all gray uniforms except the full dress
coat, on which gold braid is used. The chevrons,
although primarily a designation of rank, also serve
to distinguish some members of the classes. The
cadet officers and the sergeants are members of the
First Class and the corporals are of the Second
Class. To many people, chevrons, or insignia or
rank, means nothing. Girls especially have so little
idea of their significance that they readily swallow
anything a cadet tells them. It is the same today
as of yore. I was at a hop not long ago when
I overheard a young miss say to her cadet escort,
who had just lost his chevrons, been “busted” as
the cadets say:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span></p>

<p>“Why don’t you wear some of those lovely gold
stripes on your arm?”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;er&mdash;you see,” replied the ‘buck,’ “why
that’s a sort of private matter with me now.”</p>

<p><i>O Tempora! O Mores! Tempora Mutantur</i>, but
not at West Point.</p>

<p>Until 1816, the cadets had no regular uniform,
but were permitted to wear pretty much what
they desired. Poor chaps, I scarcely blame them,
because from the records it appears that for the
large part of the time they were in rags. In winter
especially, they hardly had enough clothes to
keep them warm. In 1814, a uniform was prescribed,
but little attention was paid to the prescribed
dress, everything being worn according to
fancy up to a major-general’s uniform. General
R. G. Ramsey (Cullum Register, Vol. III.) states
that “during the winters of 1814 and 1815 cadets
were greatly exposed to cold; great coats had not
become the fashion for boys and such comfort was
a specialty. My wardrobe had been carefully
prepared, but the inventory did not include the
great coat.” This is the first mention of the cadet
overcoat.</p>

<p>In 1816, however, an order from the Adjutant-General
changed the uniform of 1814, and with
few modifications made from time to time, this
uniform is worn today. The gray color is said to
have been adopted out of compliment to General
Scott and his troops who, clothed in gray (due to
the inability of the government to furnish them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
with blue), had, on July 4, 1814, won a victory
over the British at Chippewa.</p>

<p>Today the cadets have a few more uniforms,
but the general appearance and the pattern
have been only slightly changed since 1816. The
present list includes a full-dress coat, a single-breasted
coat of blue gray cloth, with three rows
of gilt bell buttons in front, and button-holes of
black silk cord in herring-bone form with a festoon
turned at back end. The standing collar hooks in
front and is ornamented with a blind hole of cord
formed like that of the breast with a button on
each side. The coat is cut off in front just below
the waist line, but has in rear a skirt, ornamented
with three buttons and cord holes. The full-dress
coat is a garment of rare beauty and taste. I
have never seen a more military uniform, one that
expresses so well the purpose for which it is intended.
It accentuates the good carriage of the
cadets and at the same time clothes him with an air
of elegance. It seems to me that anyone could look
smart and well set-up in a cadet full-dress coat.
When seen in full dress without his accoutrements,
the cadet, with his slim waist, his well-developed
shoulders, and chest proudly displaying those shiny
buttons, and the little tail hanging down stiffly
and conservatively, appears for all the world like
proud young cock-robin going a-courting Jenny
Wren. The full-dress coat is worn for ceremonies,
church, official receptions, hops, and for social
calls, dining out, and entertainments.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span></p>

<p>For habitual wear, a dress coat, or a blouse (as
it is more familiarly called) is prescribed. The
garment was first worn, June 15, 1889. It is of the
same style as the officers’ blouse, being of gray
cloth and bound around the edges, the cuffs, and
up the seams in the back with black mohair braid,
having a collar of the same material, of height
suited to the wearer.</p>

<p>The trousers are of gray cloth with a black stripe
up the side, one and one-half inch wide. In summer,
white is worn, either full white, blouse,
trousers, and cap, or a combination of the gray coat
and the white trousers. This mixed uniform is the
most effective, especially <i>en masse</i>, at a ceremony
when the white belt and cross belts are worn.</p>

<p>For certain drills a gray flannel shirt is issued,
and suitable breeches are provided for riding. The
various combinations of the uniform are published
in a table and designated by letter, so that the
cadet consults the table for, we will say, “Full
Dress A,” where he finds in detail all articles of
uniform to be worn for a ceremony.</p>

<p>The uniform is admirable in color, appearance,
and utility. It is regrettable that the gray color
is not used in the Regular Army instead of the
lifeless ugly olive drab. It is equally as invisible,
more attractive in appearance, no easier soiled,
and easier to clean when soiled.</p>

<p>The only article of cadet uniform that seems
out of harmony with the rest, is the cadet cap.
This headgear has no distinction and should be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
abolished. It replaced, some years ago, a forage
cap patterned after those worn in the Civil War, but
I do not think that the change was any improvement.
The visor is too drooping, and the crown,
too narrow and rigid, is clumsily fashioned. The
majority of the cadets look as if they had put on
by mistake, their small brother’s hat, giving them
a vaudeville appearance, in some cases as ludicrous
as Weber and Fields.</p>

<p>The day’s work of the Powers that Be, however,
includes so many more important things than
the appearance of a cadet cap that the style of
the cap passes by unnoticed. The great aim of the
Academy is to mold a man’s character and train
him to think. The Superintendent must constantly
keep his finger on the Academy’s pulse to
see that these aims are being successfully carried
out. To the cadets he is as far removed from their
life as were the gods of Olympus from the common
mortals. Not that the Superintendent
wishes it so, but because of circumstances. The
big problems of the Academy occupy so much of
his time that he comes into comparatively little
personal contact with the cadets. Like Henry
IV., by being seldom seen, he is, when he appears,
like a comet wondered at by them who tell each
other:</p>

<p>“That is he, the ‘Supt.’”</p>

<p>To be summoned before his presence makes a
cadet anticipate the feeling when he will appear
before the final bar of justice. He dons his full-dress
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
uniform, pulls on a pair of white lisle thread
gloves, puts a visiting card in his hat band to have
it ready for Woods, the Superintendent’s messenger,
and sallies forth, his heart a-tremble at the
thought of appearing before Olympus.</p>

<p>He quickly reviews his past, wondering what he
has done, for he thinks of course that he has
unwittingly committed some offense. It is only
when he finds himself standing before the Superintendent’s
desk saluting and saying:</p>

<p>“Sir, Cadet Ducrot reports as ordered,” that
he realizes that he is in the presence of a very
human person like himself.</p>

<p>The wonderful prestige that the Superintendent
has with the cadets is due, not so much to his
rank, but to the fact that he too was once a cadet,
and passed through experiences similar to their
own. They appreciate the success that he has
made in their chosen profession, and his example
affords inspiration to many, for they argue that
once upon a time, long ago, he too was a new cadet
in “Beast Barracks.”

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">“You</span> man, there, slouching across the Area!
What’s your name?”</p>

<p>The person addressed, a short fat chap, looks
up over his big round tortoise-shell glasses, with
unfeigned interest, but stands mute, apparently
fascinated by the immaculate white trousers and
the military bearing of the speaker.</p>

<p>“Do you hear me talking to you? What’s your
name? Take your slimy eyes off me and look to
the front!” sternly commands young Mars, coming
a few steps nearer. The new arrival looks
blank and tries to digest all of the orders at once.</p>

<p>“You other man in the green necktie, come
here!” shouts this cadet officer as he catches sight
of a tall lanky civilian in a Hart, Schaffner, Marx
suit, long flat tan shoes, and a flaming green necktie,
who has just sauntered through the sally-port.</p>

<p>“You man, there, do you hear me talking to
you? Step out!”</p>

<p>The Green Necktie smilingly approaches the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
cadet officer, deposits his dress suitcase on the
ground, and mops his brow.</p>

<p>“How do you do?” he cordially remarks, “my
name is Jinks. ”</p>

<p>The cadet officer glares.</p>

<p>“Your name is <i>Mr.</i> Jinks, <small>SIR</small>,” he shouts.
“<i>Mr.</i> Jinks, you get that!”</p>

<p>“And you too, Mr. Dumbguard,” turning to
the chap with the Harvard spectacles, “don’t you
forget to put a <i>Sir</i> on the end of your name. Who
do you think you are around here? Stand up,
both of you. Turn down the cuffs on your trousers,
button up your coats, take off all of those
badges and scarfpins and stick them in your
pocket. What do you think this place is? a
school for dudes? Put your hats on straight!”</p>

<p>Command follows command with machine-gun
rapidity. The green necktie is almost smothered
from view as the candidate buttons his coat, and
reluctantly the cuffs on the trousers are turned
down.</p>

<p>“Pick up those suitcases and follow me.”</p>

<p>“And so this is an introduction to West Point,”
ruminates the Harvard spectacles, “strikes me this
chap is somewhat brusque. I wonder where all
the other fellows are!”</p>

<p>Meanwhile over in front of the Administration
Building is a large group of candidates just reporting.
Some are laughing and joking, others remain
silent, plunged in thought, wondering why they
feel so strangely. About the same impression fills
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
each one’s mind. Underneath those parti-colored
striped shirts each heart is thumping just a little
faster than usual. The delay in reporting seems
interminable. With thoughts of all sorts racing
through their heads, they await their reception,
or their “breaking in” with fearful interest.</p>

<p class="caption">“Beast Barracks”&mdash;Drawing Mattresses</p></div>

<p>Some few have been to West Point before, but
the large majority have never been so fortunate.
They know it only by <i>Cadet Days</i>, General King’s
entertaining book of cadet life, or by <i>The Spirit of
Old West Point</i>, General Morris Schaff’s charming
reminiscent book of life in the Corps, about the
time of the Civil War, or by romantic stories
gathered here and there.</p>

<p>No words that I know of seem as magical as
“West Point.” To the candidate it conjures
a vision of all that he hopes to be. The honor of
being a cadet, the privilege of wearing the uniform,
the immense possibilities of physical and mental
achievement, the soul-satisfying fear of an ambition
about to be realized, the glamour of military
life, and, it must be admitted, a secret feeling of
righteous superiority over his boy friends at home,&mdash;all
these thoughts crowd his imagination so that
for once he sees frozen the vague ideal that he
always has had of himself.</p>

<p>I am sure that Gawain’s first impressions of
King Arthur’s court were dim in comparison with
the dazzling visions of West Point that fill the
candidate’s mind. For months, in some cases
for years, he has striven for an appointment. All
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
of his interests and hopes have been centered upon
becoming a cadet. He has read all the literature
about the place, he has gone to sleep many a night
living over in imagination his career. At last
the day comes when he sets forth on the road of his
great ambition. He can hardly believe that he
is actually on the way to West Point! What
enchanting pictures crowd his imagination and
beguile the journey! In his mind’s eye he is
arriving; he sees himself in uniform, he wonders
how he will like the life: one moment he is troubled
by the probability of failure, the next, he spans
the years in thought and is back home again on
furlough, and he thrills with pride and pleasure
at the prospect of greeting his old comrades
after an absence of two years. How delightful it
is to build castles in Spain! His imagination
runs on and on; he promises himself to study hard,
he wants his family to be proud of his record; he
hopes to be a cadet officer. In his reverie he
graduates and joins the Army, his ambition
realized. All a-tingle with excitement he eagerly
awaits the arrival at West Point.</p>

<p>When, however, the great gray buildings loom
up as the day-line boat approaches the wharf, his
buoyancy begins to ebb, his exhilaration cools
under a mental Texas Norther, and the joy of
anticipation so recently experienced receives a chill
that causes him to gaze around uneasily and forlornly.
He feels a little sad and melancholy.
Thoughts of home sweep over him.</p>

<p class="caption">Reporting for Duty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span></p></div>

<p>There is, however, about certain fellow passengers,
lean lank youths like himself, something
responsive, something about their hats, something
about the unnatural droop of the shoulders, the
new suitcases, the same fearful look that draws
him to their side. “Are you a candidate, too?”
he asks hopefully. An answer is unnecessary.
Instinct again has won, and the flood-gates of
friendship are unreservedly opened to the newly
made companion about to enter the Land of
Egypt and the House of Bondage. We are
timid creatures all of us, and even the strongest
suffer a twinge of timidity, a queer feeling in the
seat of compassion, when about to penetrate the
mystery surrounding an unknown life. At such a
moment we all want to be little children, to have
someone take us under shelter. We would like
to run away from ugly, grim Reality that relentlessly
blocks our way and with whom we must
battle before we can go forward.</p>

<p>A sort of vague terror pervades the candidate as
he climbs the hill from the station to the Adjutant’s
office where he must report, but he grasps
his suitcase and sets forth for the Headquarters
Building where his directions tell him to report
upon his arrival. If he is ahead of time he goes to
the hotel where he finds a great many candidates,
some of whom have been at the Point several days
trying to absorb some impressions before reporting.
Here friends are quickly made. On the day that
they are all ordered to report, when they feel
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
that they are about to bid farewell to their civilian
freedom, they reluctantly set out for Headquarters.
Unwilling though they may be to report,
few ever in after life regret having entered
the Academy.</p>

<p>The Rubicon once passed, however, no time is
lost in the administrative routine of receiving the
raw material. After reporting to the Adjutant,
the new cadet is turned over to an orderly who
directs him to the office of the Treasurer. No
general officer in full uniform, one month later,
could create in the candidate’s mind the same
impression of the finished military product as does
this first sight of a <i>simple soldat</i> at the Treasurer’s.
The new cadet is directed to deposit all
the money that he has in his possession. Each
new cadet is supposed to deposit one hundred and
sixty dollars upon entrance to cover an initial cost
of equipment, which amount is credited to the
cadet’s account, together with any surplus change
that he has at the time of admission. Although
the Regulations require this initial deposit of
one hundred and sixty dollars, the requirement
is not absolutely obligatory, so that if any boy
receives an appointment he should not be deterred
from accepting on account of the financial stipulation.
He should come at all events. The
first equipment will be issued, and with economy
he can later on wipe out the debt. If a boy’s
parents are poor, it would be foolish for them to
make a great effort to raise this money. Let the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
boy come and assume the responsibility of the
debt, and let the onus of it rest upon his more
youthful shoulders which will very soon broaden to
bear it. One by one the men pass the little wicket
window of the Treasurer and deposit all their
money. Pockets are emptied of all cash and
checks, which are credited to the cadet’s account.
When eight, ten, or twelve candidates have been
admitted, the young officer present forms them
into a pseudo squad, or rather group, then calls
an orderly of the Regular Army.</p>

<p>“Show these young gentlemen over to the Area
of Barracks to the office of the Officer in Charge of
New Cadets.”</p>

<p>The orderly comes briskly to attention, his
smart salute captivating the assorted collection
of “Prides of Congressional Districts.” They
promptly follow his leadership, out of the postern
gate of Headquarters, across the road to the Area
of Barracks, reveling in the clouds of glory that,
in their eyes, he trails behind him. They are now
quite happy, fully launched upon their military
careers.</p>

<p>The feeling of elation at being at last within the
sacred halls of the Academy begins to intoxicate
the new cadet, when, upon the way over to the
barracks, he notices a few stray passersby stop,
look at the queer squad, and then smile slowly,
almost insinuatingly, as if amused. It is an
irritating smile. He sees the orderly smile too.
Something has surely gone wrong. His heart
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
goes down, down, down, and he soon feels as if
someone had thrown about him a cloak of lead.
But on the squad goes. He tries to shake off his
heavy feeling, but it is no use. Many days elapse
before the heavy mantle is cast aside. He is sure
that something dreadful is about to happen. But
stay, what is all this disturbance in the Area?
Running back and forth between a sally-port and a
barracks are a lot of bareheaded individuals, some
in military shirt and cit trousers, others in lovely
pink striped shirts and gray cadet trousers. They
appear very uncomfortable. Several well set-up
young cadets are at their heels giving them
instructions in stern tones.</p>

<p>“Say, soldier, who are those men?” inquires one
bold candidate.</p>

<p>“Those men are your new classmates,” explains
the orderly.</p>

<p>Just then a lieutenant comes forward; the
orderly turns over his charges and the men of
the squad take their places in line with many other
candidates who are awaiting their turn to report to
the Officer in Charge. No sooner have they placed
their grips on the ground, and begun to take life
easy while waiting, than a flock of yearling corporals
emerge from the Guardhouse.</p>

<p>“Stand up all along this line!” commands one.</p>

<p>“Hold up your heads, and drag in your chins,”
shouts another, as he goes down the line giving
each new cadet a little personal attention.</p>

<p>“Mr. Dumbguard, put that hat on straight.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<i>Photo White Studio</i></p>

<p class="caption">Two Hours after Reporting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span></p></div>

<p>All hats are at once adjusted. The whole line
assumes an extraordinary appearance of rigidity.
The heat becomes more intense. Large drops,
globules of perspiration, roll off the crimson faces
whose features have assumed a permanent set,
depicting grief. Slowly the line advances. More
cadet officers appear, giving each candidate the
number of his room in barracks.</p>

<p>“Mr. Ducrot, your room is 1223, step out and
find it, put your baggage there and report back
here immediately.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ducrot, whose intellect has become somewhat
clouded by all of the events and instructions
that he has received in the last ten minutes,
hurries off in the direction of the twelfth division.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The instruction of new cadets is under an officer
of the Tactical Department. In his work he has
both officer and cadet assistants.</p>

<p>In order that the cadets themselves might have
experience in breaking in new men, cadets of the
First (or senior) class are detailed as assistant
instructors. They drill the new cadets in the
school of the soldier and of the squad. They give
him individual instruction in the care of his room,
his correspondence, and in the use and care of his
equipment and his personal hygiene. It is highly
desirable that the new cadet should feel the
influence of the older cadet. I shall never forget
my first impressions of my cadet instructors. I
thought that I had never seen such immaculate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
human beings in my life. With their straight
backs, their lean faces, piercing eyes that stared
coldly almost contemptuously at me, I was sure
that they were all English generals imported direct
from the Boer War. I didn’t know that white
duck trousers could be so white, nor brass buckles
so shiny. I was then sure that I had an incapacity
for military life, that I would never attain such
a degree of excellence, and I inwardly withered
before their glory.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Ducrot and his fellow candidates,
having found their rooms in barracks, are
approaching the Guardhouse at a dead run upon
the insistence of a cadet corporal. Once again
they stand in front of their instructors who glare
at them like Men of Wrath.</p>

<p>“Fall in,” commands the fiercest looking one.</p>

<p>A shuffling of feet, indefinite movements as if
to do something, a few emphatic remarks by a
corporal, and a semblance of a line is formed.
Two Messrs. Ducrot ignore the suggestion of the
Wrathful One, until a fresh-faced lieutenant almost
pulls them into line.</p>

<p>The squad is now herded over to the Cadet Store
to have issued the initial uniform, consisting of
a gray shirt, campaign hat, cap, and gray flannel
trousers.</p>

<p>In less than half an hour a complete metamorphosis
takes place. The heterogeneous crowd of
candidates that entered the store has lost the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
appearance of a bargain counter on sale day. By
no means, however, have they gained a military aspect:
all that can be said is that they are harmoniously
clothed. It takes time to learn to wear a
uniform properly, and nothing is funnier than a
new cadet in his first outfit. These garments
have been made up in stock sizes so that an issue
can be made at once. The fit is fairly good,
except the blouses. A plebe, however, soon
appreciates a loose blouse. When the cadet instructors
command:</p>

<p>“Mr. Dumbguard, get those shoulders back.
More yet! More yet!” a number of wrinkles
appear in the back of the blouse. The looser
therefore it is, the less effort is necessary to produce
many wrinkles, and therefore, the task of
appeasing the Man of Wrath easier.</p>

<p>The first day’s work goes on rapidly. As soon
as the new uniforms are donned, once again to the
Cadet Store go the new cadets to draw their room
equipment.</p>

<p>“New cadets, turn out promptly!” command
the cadet instructors in the lower hall of each
division. Down the iron steps hurriedly come running
the novitiates, and line up in the Area. At
the Cadet Store, each man is issued his mattress,
pillows, and bedding. A long procession of young
Atlases, sweating like horses, stagger through the
sally-port, bearing aloft everything necessary for
sleeping, except the bed. A few zealous ones add
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
to the burden a bucket, perhaps a dipper rattling
inside, and a broom that sways recklessly on the
top of the mattress. Concealed somewhere in the
mass is a bottle of indelible ink that is sure to drop
before the room is reached. Standing in the
Area are a few of the Wrathful tribe ever on the
alert to see that no loitering occurs.</p>

<p>“Take up a double time, Mr. Ducrot, step out!”</p>

<p>Poor Mr. Ducrot, this time about five feet four
inches tall, whose view has been obscured by the
side of a mattress, attempts to be more of a hustler,
stubs his toe, and down come pillows, mattress,
bucket, and all.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Ducrot, you’re a pretty mess, you’re
about the grossest plebe I ever saw!” consoles one
sarcastic Arch-Fiend.</p>

<p>“What do you think you’re trying to celebrate
out here, Mr. Dumbguard,” cuts in another, “do
you think you’re going to take a nap?”</p>

<p>The senior cadet officer comes forward:</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble?” he inquires.</p>

<p>Mr. Ducrot (after remembering to raise his hand
in imitation of a salute) speaks up from the midst
of his debâcle:</p>

<p>“I was ...”</p>

<p>“Sir! Sir!” commands the officer.</p>

<p>“Sir,” recommences Mr. Ducrot, “I was coming
through the sally-port when&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Further details of this domestic tragedy are cut
short by the roll of a drum.</p>

<p>“Pick up that stuff and get ready for dinner.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span></p>

<p>“Step out! Step out!” orders the cadet officer.</p>

<p>Dinner! Dinner! Beloved dinner! the thought
fills Mr. Ducrot with ecstasy. Here it is twelve-thirty
and he has been at it since 5:30. It seems
three years.</p>

<p>At dinner formation, “Mr. Ducrot, Mr. Dumbguard
and Co.” learn how to “brace,” a term
used to denote the position of the shoulders well
down and back, with the head erect and chin in,
hands close to the side. The companies are
marched, after a fashion, to the Mess Hall. The
cadet instructors accompany the new cadets continually
commanding:</p>

<p>“Mr. Duflickit, drag in that chin!” “Hold
your head up, No. 2, 1st squad!”</p>

<p>Once in the Mess Hall, the new cadet is allowed
to eat all he wishes without interference. At the
meal, however, he must comply with the instructions
for the position of a cadet at table in the Mess
Hall.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This position shall be wholly without constraint.
While eating the body shall be erect on the hips, inclining
slightly forward, elbows off the table. When
not eating he will sit at ease in his chair, erect or
leaning back as he desires. His forearms may be kept
in his lap, or his hand or hands may rest easily upon
the table. At no time in the Mess Hall shall he tilt
his chair back or elevate his feet, or turn his chair
away from the table. Whenever a cadet is spoken
to in the Mess Hall, he will look at the person speaking
to him.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span></p>

<p>But who cares, this first meal, about the position
at table? Nothing matters except to satisfy
that ravenous appetite!</p>

<p>Dinner over, the tragedy of the afternoon is enacted.
West Point pays no attention to the style
of hair cutting preferred by the aspirant for military
honors. All cadets must be shorn alike. The
new cadets are consequently marched to the barber
shop wherefrom a long line of shaggy headed plebes
protrudes like some serpent caught in a noose.
What a sight is that barber shop! Hair everywhere:
black hair, red hair, yellow hair, and some
that resembles sun-burnt vanilla. Thick wavy
locks, the despair of some distant damsel, drop
dejectedly one by one. The hair must be kept
short at all times so that it is impossible to distinguish
at West Point cadets with histrionic
leanings, or those poetically and musically inclined.</p>

<p>No rest yet in sight, this busiest of days. First
the rooms must be arranged strictly according
to the Regulations&mdash;a place for everything and
everything in its place. Dozens of times are the
belts piled, only to be pulled down and thrown on
the floor by the Wrathful Tribe detailed to see
that the task is correctly done. The bedding
suffers the same ignominious treatment, for the
slightest irregularity in arrangement is met with
severe punishment. It seems hard and discouraging,
but, later on, the reason for such strict
compliance with orders appears. Only by constant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
repetition do new cadets learn to do a thing
thoroughly.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_114" src="images/i_114.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">The Interior of a Cadet’s Room in Barracks</p></div>

<p>Tired out in body and brain, Mr. Ducrot sits on
the edge of his bed for a moment’s rest, when:</p>

<p>“New cadets turn out promptly!” echoes
through the hall of the Division. Not a moment
is lost in complying with this command.</p>

<p>He rushes down the stairs in a bewildered sort
of way wondering what calamity is about to befall.</p>

<p>“Hurry up, Mr. Dumbguard, what do you
mean by coming out here late?” greets his appearance
upon the stoop of the barracks. From all
the divisions new cadets are scampering to their
places in ranks along the cement walk.</p>

<p>But who are the grave-looking officials in blue
uniforms? The question is not long unanswered.
The new cadets are lined up along three sides of a
square. The National colors and the Corps colors
are brought to the center. The Notary Public, in
the presence of the Superintendent and his staff,
reads the oath of allegiance to the assembled new
body, who with right hands raised toward Heaven,
swear their fealty to the United States. The
ceremony is simple, but to the plebe tremendously
impressive. When he agrees to give four years’
service to the Government after graduation, he
feels as if he is signing away his life.</p>

<p>There is no cloud without its silver lining. To
Mr. Ducrot’s great joy, the chief Man of Wrath
commands:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span></p>

<p>“New cadets will immediately take a bath.”</p>

<p>For the first time since reporting he enjoys
a little relaxation, splashing around under the
showers, where occur stolen confidences when the
instructors are busy elsewhere. A refreshed
feeling creeps over Mr. Ducrot and he double times
back to his room to await the inspection of his
shoes and feet. Pretty soon, in pops the officer in
charge with tapes and foot sticks for taking the
measure of shoes. Alas, no pointed toes or English
lasts are allowed:&mdash;all cadets must wear a
sensible military shoe. Regularly, are Mr. Ducrot’s
feet inspected during his first few weeks
to remedy ill-fitting shoes and prevent cases of
soreness.</p>

<p>Years ago in the days of hazing, a vastly different
sort of inspection of feet occurred. This
was an unofficial inspection of the plebe’s feet by
upper-classmen. In the middle of the night when
the tired plebe was snoring away, dreaming of
being late to a formation and pursued by raging
demons, he was suddenly awakened by a hollow
voice in his tent, commanding:</p>

<p>“Inspec-shun! Feet,” the “feet” said crisply
and emphatically.</p>

<p>Without delay Mr. Ducrot sticks his bare feet
out for the inspection of the midnight prowler.
He then, by order, opens his toes into the intervals
of which the gloating upper-classman poured
melted candle grease, thereby ending the inspection.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span></p>

<p>At eight-thirty in the evening, Mr. Ducrot,
wearily but joyfully, makes down his bed that has
remained folded all day long. At last, he is to
have a rest, blessed sleep is in sight.</p>

<p>At nine o’clock the orderly in front of the Guardhouse
beats three taps on his drum and simultaneously
the cry:</p>

<p>“Lights out!” echoes through the halls of the
divisions. Immediately the barracks are plunged
into darkness and silence. Only the tread of the
cadet officer doing his half-hour patrol in the Area,
disturbs the stillness of the night.</p>

<p>Mr. Ducrot sinks back upon his pillow, dead
tired, almost too tired to sleep, and strives to
bring a little order out of the chaos of his mind.
The oft-repeated names Ducrot, Dumbjohn,
Duflicket, Dumbguard float through his head,
indescribably confused with mattresses, pillows,
stern-looking cadet officers, vicious yearling
corporals, rows of red-faced plebes, chins drawn
way in, and the perspiration streaming down
their faces. The events of the day are hopelessly
jumbled in his mind. A feeling almost
of failure creeps over him, and in the solitude
of the night a yearning for his home seizes him.
All through his breast spasmodic sharp pains
play hide and seek. The great loneliness to
which men are prey, fills him with sadness
and melancholy until a pleasing drowsiness drifts
along and smothers Mr. Ducrot into unconsciousness.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span></p>

<p>This period of training of the new cadet is
familiarly called “Beast Barracks.” It lasts for
about three weeks, at the end of which these new
men are sent to camp to join the Battalions. It is
necessary to segregate them for at least this
length of time: otherwise they would be so wooden
that they would be sticking their front rank files
in the head with a bayonet.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to discern the origin of the name
“Beast Barracks.” In the cadets’ mind, their
breaking in is only comparable to the taming
of some wild animals. The training is undeniably
severe for a tenderfoot, but its “beastly” character
is an imaginary creation. To the new man, however,
it seems awfully real. I well remember my
own feelings. When I was standing in the fierce
sun, “bracing” in ranks along the cement walk of
the Area, occasionally a white dog upon the hill
opposite would come lazily snooping around the
ash cans: I envied him his freedom. It seemed
to me that I envied everyone except my classmates
in misery. In my imagination I saw in flaming
letters above every door I entered: “Abandon all
hope ye who enter here.”</p>

<p>As I was re-christened Mr. Ducrot, I began to
think I was someone else, I felt as if I must have
died and that this was my second tour on earth, a
punishment for a wicked first life.</p>

<p>“There must be some way of getting out of
this,” I reflected, but then, I thought that if the
officers and cadets in charge of me had gone
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
through with this training I could also. And I
did,&mdash;Alleluiah!</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_118" src="images/i_118.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Moving from Barracks to Camp</p></div>

<p>It was a long time, too, before I found out how all
of us came to be addressed as Mr. Ducrot. During
the academic year when I began to study French
I made his acquaintance. He appeared in Keetel’s
French Grammar, in the exercises of which the
older cadets had uncovered a mysterious scandal
concerning his private life. All plebes were at once
required to relate to the upper-classmen the following
bit of gossip, known as the famous Ducrot
scandal. 1. Monsieur Ducrot a un fils et <i>une
fille</i>. 2. Madame Ducrot a un fils et <i>deux filles</i>.
<i>Scandal.</i> The name became traditional in the
Corps and was, with many others, applied indiscriminately
to all plebes.</p>

<p>Early the next morning, Mr. Ducrot, whom we
left sleeping, attends his first reveille. Although
the drums do not begin to play until five-twenty,
he steals out of bed long before and conscientiously
sweeps, dusts, shaves, and dresses, for fear of not
being on time for the formation. Boom! sounds
the morning gun! Down the iron steps all the
Mr. Ducrots noisily clatter, bolt out to the cement
walk where they remain rigidly at attention for
ten minutes until the cadet officers emerge half
awake and disagreeable. Woe unto the sleepy-headed
plebe who is late! As he peeks his head
out of the Division door a couple of the Wrathful
meet him and convoy him at top speed to his
place in ranks. I was once late: I shall never
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
forget the experience. When my “Boer War Generals”
were chasing me I was seized with the same
terror that a child has in dreaming of being pursued
by a burly policeman and unable to run.</p>

<p>At 5:50 the cadet instructors make a cursory
inspection of the rooms to see that they are
in order before breakfast. Before entering they
knock sharply on the door, an authoritative knock,
but one flavored with a little bravado. Two
immovable, gray-clad figures, with eyes glassily
fixed on the wall in front of them, chins caressing
their Adam’s apple, shoulders way back, stand
near the fireplace, looking for all the world like a
couple of spoiled children about to cry, while the
inspector rubs his white gloves over the tables and
chairs.</p>

<p>Upon the second day commences the instruction
of the new cadet in the elementary drills.</p>

<p>During the first few weeks the following schedule
is carried out:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Infantry Instruction</td>
    <td class="tdr">7:15-7:45 a. m.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Physical Exercises</td>
    <td class="tdr">8:15-9:00 a. m.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Infantry Instruction</td>
    <td class="tdr">9:30-10:15 a. m.</td>
    <td />
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td />
    <td class="tdr">10:45-11:30 a. m.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td />
    <td class="tdr">3:00-3:40 p. m.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td />
    <td class="tdr">4:15-5:00 p. m.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Each day the course of instruction is definitely
prescribed by the officer in charge. At the first
drill the new cadets are taught the school of the
soldier, the marchings, haltings, facings, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
saluting. These exercises are given without
rifles. Usually the second drill is given under
arms. As the service rifle weighs nine pounds, it
is desirable to accustom gradually these young
lads to its weight. To one unaccustomed to carrying
a rifle, it seems, after a short while, to bore into
your shoulder. Any officer who has ever been a
cadet will never require an enlisted man to carry
his rifle too long, until fatigued. His own experience
in “Beast Barracks” remains too vivid.</p>

<p>The instruction is progressive, so that the cadets
are gradually assembled into squads, the squads
into platoons, the platoons into companies.
Naturally, some men improve faster than others.
Those whose intellects seem befogged by the
complexities of the drills are formed into what is
known as the “Awkward Squad” whence, as they
progress, they are transferred. Last year one
bright cadet instructor thought of a practical joke
to inspire the new cadets to do their very best.
It seems that the schedule of drills included a
“sightseeing tour” around the Post, in order
to familiarize the new cadets with their surroundings.
The plebes were told that only the most
efficient would go on this tour. Consequently great
efforts were made by members of the awkward
squad to increase their military efficiency. As the
instructors knew and the plebes later discovered
the “sightseeing trip” was anything but a treat.
It was made on a broiling hot summer’s afternoon
at a rapid walk, and not after the fashion of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
Metropolitan rubberneck wagons. Objects of interest
were pointed out in the most military manner:
1. Eyes Right; 2. Hudson River; 3. Front,
or, 1. Eyes Left; 2. Battle Monument; 3. Front!</p>

<p>Sandwiched between the infantry morning drill
are the physical exercises. This name will make
the plebes laugh, for all drills are physical exercises,
but I intend it as a distinguishing name for a drill
where the essence of exercise is dispensed. This
drill is now given in the Gymnasium and consists
of every known form of setting-up exercises that
can be devised. For forty-five minutes the cadet
executes them, both at halt and while marching.
He is given frequent short rests of half a minute
or a minute, after every different exercise, but
nevertheless it seems to the naturally fatigued new
cadet, as if every muscle, every sinew, and every
bone was being relentlessly punished.</p>

<p>These setting-up exercises are a potent influence
in the new cadets’ physical development, and when
the fresh young body has become accustomed
to them, they act as a tonic, an elixir. To a visitor
the drill is always interesting as it is rather spectacular,
due to the numbers acting in unison and
with perfect cadence.</p>

<p>The early afternoon is devoted to the nomenclature
and cleaning of the rifle. Scattered in groups
in the shade of the old gymnasium or the Cadet
Store, perspiring plebes take their rifles apart
and, after cleaning them, try their utmost to put
them together again.</p>

<p class="caption">A First Lesson in Saluting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span></p></div>

<p>Infantry drills fill the remainder of the afternoon
until 5:00 <small>P.M.</small>, when there comes a chance to wash
away the grime before retreat. Immediately after
the lowering of the flag each afternoon is an
inspection in ranks, for which all plebes must
be carefully groomed. Each man must appear
with immaculate linen and with his blouse and cap,
and shoes carefully brushed. Mr. Ducrot dreads
the inspection more than any other duty. Despite
his care in dressing, the inspectors are sure to espy
a tiny wisp from the clothes brush clinging to his
cap or blouse, whereupon His Highness says:</p>

<p>“What do you mean by falling into ranks
covered with straw?” Perhaps Mr. Ducrot is just
seventeen years old with only a soupçon of hair on
his face.</p>

<p>“Why, what’s this,” inquires a sharp-eyed
inspector. “Mr. Ducrot, why didn’t you shave
today? I see three hairs sticking out of your
chin. Drag in your chin.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ducrot’s sense of humor overcomes him
even in his miserable state of mind and the corners
of his mouth begin to twitch.</p>

<p>“Wipe that smile off your face!” commands
the cadet officer.</p>

<p>Up goes the hand: the offending emotion is
erased.</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Ducrot, throw it upon the ground
and stamp upon it. Don’t you ever again
smile in ranks.” Mr. Ducrot begins to feel that
the Wrathful Ones are quite human after all and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
he feels cheered up for the remainder of the day.
Up and down the line walk the cadet officers inspecting
and “bracing” the plebes, commanding:</p>

<p>“Get your shoulders back! More yet! More
yet!”</p>

<p>“Hold your head up; drag in your chin!”</p>

<p>“Suck up your stomach! Lean forward on
your hips!” and so on.</p>

<p>For three weeks the new cadets are put through
this severe course of instruction before they are
deemed fit to be put in the ranks of the older cadets
without ruining the appearance of the Battalions.</p>

<p>It is astonishing to behold the progress made in
elementary training in this short period. It is
true that the days are crammed full, and the
instruction is of the most intensive kind, but
even so the results far exceed what might be
expected under the most rigorous of systems.</p>

<p>In the first place, the men lose all appearance of
slovenliness and begin to acquire a distinct military
bearing. The unevenness of gait is replaced by
a measured tread, the hanging of heads and drooping
of shoulders gives way to an erect smart
carriage, and the excessive swinging of arms disappears.
The group of very crude-looking individuals
of the first few days has been changed
into a harmonious appearing military body.
Little by little the new men have begun to adjust
themselves to their uniforms.</p>

<p>No less marked is the change of the mental
attitude of the new cadet at the end of “Beast
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
Barracks.” All sense of his own importance, if
he ever had any, has oozed away rapidly. Like
Bob Acres, it sneaked out of the ends of his fingers
the first few days, and he realizes what a very
small fish he is in this new pond. He rapidly
acquires a most receptive mood in which he
absorbs the most important lesson that a soldier
must learn,&mdash;<small>OBEDIENCE</small>. The officers and cadets
in charge of him demand unhesitating and
instant compliance with their orders. To this
end the new cadets are made to execute every
order at a run, not to harass them as they sometimes
think, but to form the habit of immediate
obedience. This trait is the foundation of discipline,
toward the inculcation of which in the new
cadet, an excellent beginning is made in “Beast
Barracks.”</p>

<p>At the end of three weeks the “Beasts” are
moved from Barracks to join the rest of the Corps
in camp. You ought to see them move. Carrying
their Lares and Penates in striped laundry
bags, or on canvas stretchers, they come and go
all morning across the Plain in parallel rows,
resembling for all the world a colony of ants
building its new home. Upon arrival in camp,
they join the companies to which they have been
assigned, and from the state of “Beast” they
are raised to the dignity of a plebe, the next lowest
grade in the cadet hierarchy.</p>

<p>“Beast Barracks” is over, but its memory
remains fresher than any other at West Point.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
In spite of the new and more interesting training
of camp life, Mr. Ducrot is forever haunted
by recollections of perspiration and indelible ink.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span></p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />

<span class="large">BENDING THE TWIG</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Only</span> when the three hundred odd new cadets
have been transferred to camp and joined
the Battalion, do they begin to feel that they are
members of the Corps. They are, however, ill-formed,
crude, ungainly members, and from the
moment they pass the hedge that screens the
camp from the visitors’ seats, the Tactical gardeners
begin the work of bending these natural
twigs, so recently transplanted from the individualistic
soil of civilian life to the orthodox ground of
military training.</p>

<p>Realizing how difficult it is for a young man to
adapt himself to the changed conditions that he
meets at West Point, the authorities require the
new cadet to report in June, just as the academic
year has closed, in order that he may receive the
benefit of the summer-camp training before taking
up his studies. The physical fatigue that the new
plebe experiences is really so great, that he would
not be able to plunge into the academic course
before his body has become accustomed to the
demands made upon it. The aching muscles, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
drooping eyes, that awful heaviness of fatigue must
all be given time to pass away so that the mind may
be free to pursue its development. To this end, he
goes into camp after his first few weeks in “Beast
Barracks.”</p>

<p>The camp is prettily situated in the northeast
corner of the Plain along the bluff overlooking the
Hudson. In form it is rectangular, laid out for six
companies whose streets are centrally cut by an
avenue known as the general parade. The streets
are parallel to the parade ground proper, from
which they are separated and screened by a hedge.</p>

<p>Nor is the cadet camp lacking in the features
that make every permanent camp comfortable and
convenient for the soldier. For these creature
comforts, the cadets have been at times criticised
on the ground that soldiers in the field should be
content with the bare necessities of life. The cadet
camp, however, is intended as a camp of instruction
only. In military life there are two kinds of
camps, the permanent camp and the temporary
camp. In the latter, soldiers live close to nature
dispensing with the hundred and one little conveniences
that all of us today consider necessary
to our physical well-being, but in the former,
such as the cadet encampment, the soldier is provided
with a maximum of comfort&mdash;and why
not? The illustrated magazines that help to bring
us closer to the Great War in Europe give visual
proof that when men remain for any length of
time in one place, even in the zone of danger,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
they build and adorn abodes. It may be that
an enemy shell will destroy these shelters the
next moment, but the domestic instinct remains
unimpaired. Some of the bomb-proof dugouts on
the western front are miniature triumphs of architecture
and comfort. The occupation year after
year of the cadet camp has had the same effect.
We therefore see today a camp with graveled company
streets that are illuminated at night by electricity.
The tents, instead of being pegged, are
supported by galvanized iron rails. The dim
candle of olden times is replaced by the brilliant
electric bulb, and the cadet, instead of reposing
his weary bones on the hard wooden floor, slumbers
luxuriously on a Gold Medal cot.</p>

<p>A large central tent, like a mother hen watching
over her brood, is reserved for the Commandant of
Cadets. The tents of the cadet officers are on the
opposite edge of the space in front of the Tactical
officers’ tents, the next indication of hierarchical
authority. Then come the tents of the non-commissioned
officers and the privates.</p>

<p>To have a neat-looking camp, strict regulations
govern the arrangement of the tents. Twice a day
they are aligned. Due to changes in the temperature,
the supporting cords lengthen or shorten, so
that the front tent-pole gets out of alignment.
Then an authoritative voice rings out:</p>

<p>“Turn out, ‘B’ company, and straighten your
tent-poles!” Whereupon cadets in all conditions of
dress and undress tumble out of the little brown
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
canvas homes. When it rains the cords must be
loosened at the first pitter-patter of the raindrops
on the tent-fly. The new plebe sitting in
his underwear in his tent, probably polishing his
breastplate for the twenty-fifth time that day,
does not realize that this duty must be performed
until a dozen or more yearlings command from
the recesses of the canvas bungalows:</p>

<p>“Turn out, you plebes, and loosen those tent-cords!”
Out they jump into the “catacombs”
(the space between the tents), bumping their heads
against the rails, and at once commence tugging at
the obstinate, water-soaked tent-cords, while the
summer downpour soaks them to the skin.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To each tent two cadets are assigned, one of
whom performs for a week at a time the duty of
tent orderly. Whenever the cadet detailed for
orderly is absent on account of duty or sickness, his
tent-mate becomes responsible. In order that the
Tactical officer in charge of any company may
know which cadet is responsible, there is fastened
on the front tent-pole, a revolving octagonal disk
of wood, about three inches in diameter. Both
cadets’ names, as well as the words “Guard”
“Sick,” are printed on the face of the disk, along
one of the sides, and the disk revolved to indicate
the name of the orderly, or the cause of the occupant’s
absence. The orderly is also supposed to
keep the water bucket filled, but the occupants
of each tent usually have some private treaty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
whose provisions prescribe which one shall “drag”
the water from the hydrant.</p>

<p>Generally speaking the orderly is responsible
for the cleanliness and police of the tent, and of the
ground adjacent and in front, as far as the middle
of the company street where the rubbish is swept
into a pile to be removed by the policemen. These
men are civilian employees, many of whom have
been at the Academy so long that they are intimately
identified with the Corps. In time, some
of them will fade into legendary characters much
the same as Benny Havens. Promptly at police
call at five o’clock, the wheelbarrow squad commanded
by “Mike,” “Frank,” or “Tony,” moves
ceremoniously down the street collecting the sweepings.
At this hour the camp presents an animated
scene. Cadets are busily dragging the ground
around their tents with a broom to give it a
“spoony” appearance for inspection, and every
few minutes some one man will dart out to the
center of the street with a stray match or piece of
paper and throw it in the passing wheelbarrow.</p>

<p>The interior of the tent contains a wooden clothes-press
and usually a canvas stretcher suspended from
the ridge pole. Each cadet has a certain section
for his clothes. All articles, belts, gloves, socks
must be folded and arranged in a prescribed manner.
The cots are folded and kept out of sight
during the day. Gray, painted wooden lockers
for storing cleaning material and clothing border
one side of the tent floor. Many cadets, however,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
secrete food, known as “Boodle” in these convenient
places, and I am sure that an unexpected
inspection would reveal many tins of saltines,
bottles of olives, and jars of peanut butter. During
my cadet days, the officer in charge of my
company never, for some reason, looked into the
lockers. My tent-mate and I therefore grew more
and more bold about filling them with vast supplies
of “Boodle,” and we began to think that
the “Tac” was inspired by a sort of <i>noblesse oblige</i>
where the lockers were concerned, a sort of sympathetic
remembrance of his own cadet-gnawing
appetite. One Saturday, however, just as he was
leaving and I was offering a silent prayer of thanksgiving,
he ordered the lockers opened. A gallon
jar in which some fifty olives lay submerged and
a slovenly looking pineapple cheese met my humiliated
gaze. A reprimand that as a cadet officer
I should set an example to the rest of the company,
and five demerits, were awarded to me forthwith.</p>

<p>When the tents are not prepared for inspection,
however, cadets may make down the cots and rest.
How wonderfully refreshing it is to rest! to throw
oneself down on the blankets and forget the heat,
the weary march, the grime, the dust, and abandon
oneself to the delights of the imagination, dreaming
of the sweetness of the past or building vast plans
for the future! How precious to the cadet is each
moment of repose snatched from the busy day!
But it is in the morning that the real longing for
sleep becomes most acute.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span></p>

<p>Every morning at 5:20, the solitary boom of
the reveille gun is echoed throughout the hills,
rudely dissipating the fog of unconsciousness that
envelops the sleeping cadets. Little by little the
deathlike slumber of the camp is broken. Indistinct
sounds, a sigh, a yawn, float gently out upon
the air; drugged forms twist and roll uncertainly
beneath the mosquito bars, as if struggling in a
bewildered sort of way to preserve the pleasing
heaviness that charms their bodies.</p>

<p>Suddenly the air is torn by the shrill garrulous
fifes and the lusty rub-a-dub-dub of the drums.
The reveille march has begun. Around the camp
the “Hell Cats” march, up one street, down another
like demons possessed. The shrieking sounds
of the fifes and the deep rolling noise of the drums
brusquely rout the stillness of the dawn, while the
semi-conscious forms toy with danger, beguiling
themselves that there is plenty of time until the assembly.
Presently from near the general parade
the familiar warning notes of <i>Yankee Doodle</i> change
the camp to a place of intense animation. Up go
mosquito bars and in a twinkling, almost as if by
magic, tents disgorge their sleepy occupants, hastily
and feverishly buttoning their uniforms as they run
to their places in ranks to the fading rolls of the
drum corps.</p>

<p>After reveille it takes but a few minutes
to police the tents and perform the necessary
ablutions before breakfast. The drills commence
within a half-hour after the morning meal and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
continue until noon. They are of various kinds,
the majority of which will be described in the
chapter entitled “Lessons from Mars,” but I
will speak of the plebe’s work in his first camp,
since it is somewhat different.</p>

<p>The physical exercises given to the new cadet
in “Beast Barracks” are continued in camp. In
addition, he is sent to the Gymnasium for swimming,
where a professional instructor is present
to see that no one drowns, and to teach the various
strokes. As many of the cadets are adept swimmers
upon entrance, they are tested, and those
found qualified are excused from further attendance.
The men who cannot swim, the real “land lubbers,”
attend daily until they are proficient.</p>

<p>The most diverting instruction, however, in
plebe camp is the dancing lesson. A civilian professor
spends the summer at West Point to instruct
the fourth classmen in the Terpsichorean art.
Every morning at hour intervals, squads of cadets
carrying their pumps march across the parade to
Cullum Hall. Here they remove their coats, put
on their pumps, and line themselves along the wall.
The waltz step is first taught as the basis of all
dancing, then later the two-step, and, since the
new dances have come upon us, the fox-trot and
one-step are rehearsed toward the end of the
course. The dancing lesson is not open to visitors.
Once upon a time it was, but long cadets, short
cadets, fat cadets, lean cadets, awkward and graceful
ones, all tiptoeing, “one- and two- and threeing”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
around the room like a lot of coy young
hippopotami with compass bearings lost, became a
famous sight for tourists, who wanted to enjoy a
good laugh. How could anyone learn to dance in
the presence of a giggling crowd! But the crowd
wasn’t to blame! Here in one corner was a little slender
chap delicate as a reed, perspiring in his efforts
to steer his six-foot partner, a regular steam
roller, through the mazes of Professor Vesay’s
old-fashioned waltz. Again, all over the room,
self-conscious boys in white shirt-sleeves were
in a bewildered state trying to execute the
Professor’s directions:</p>

<p>“Right foot in second position&mdash;glide and cut!”
Nowadays an officer excludes all sightseers during
the lesson.</p>

<p>The instruction of the plebe in infantry drill
continues uninterruptedly, for it is essential that
he should not spoil the appearance of the rest of
the battalion. Together with swimming, dancing,
and infantry drill, his morning is completely occupied.
After the midday dinner, he is assembled
in squad for instruction in hygiene and guard duty,
or he may be required to spend his time working
upon his equipment, his brasses, his bayonet, and
rifle.</p>

<p>Very little social diversion is permitted to the
plebe, because he is usually awkward in appearance
and unfamiliar with military customs and deportment.
Consequently he considers that his life
is excessively hard, to him unnecessarily so; but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
as I have observed cadets for thirteen years I
am convinced of the wisdom of holding them in
a distinct class for one year. Then they emerge
from the cocoon of plebedom as dazzling yearling
butterflies.</p>

<p>To afford instruction in guard duty the camp
is surrounded by sentinels. A quota of cadets
from each company marches on guard immediately
after parade in the evening. There are three
reliefs for each of the ten posts: three corporals,
a sergeant, and two officers of the guard, and an
officer of the day. The guard is under the control
and supervision of the officer in charge, who is one
of the Tactical officers. Each sentinel walks two
hours and rests four, so that during the twenty-four
hours the cadet walks eight hours. The effect
of this duty upon the cadet is lasting, for it
teaches him the fatigue a sentinel experiences and
prevents him, when an officer, from demanding
too much of his men. The borders of the camp
are divided into posts, numbered from 1 to 10.</p>

<p>The first important duty demanded of the
plebe is guard. With what quivering sensations
this youthful soldier approaches his first real test!
Before he goes on guard he is instructed in his
orders, both general and special, but few feel as if
they knew them well enough to stand the ordeal
of an inspection by a yearling corporal. No opportunity
is lost, therefore, before the hour to
march on post to perfect his knowledge, so that
after supper little groups of excited and nervous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
plebes study diligently these orders under the pale
and insect-infested lamp-posts near the guard
tent. In the obscure light these slim gray forms,
some seated and some standing, seem shadowy and
motionless except for their gloves, little dabs of
white that move restlessly to and fro, attacking
the ubiquitous mosquitoes.</p>

<p>The nearby guard tents under the elms are
dark except the main one where sit the officers of
the guard, who keep the record of a stream of
gay upper-classmen, signing out for the hops and
concerts. How far off they are to the plebe!
It seems to each one, as he watches them from the
shadows, that there is an impassable gulf between
them, and he wonders as he listens to their hurried
voices calling, “Ducrot, hop with,” or “Dumbguard,
hop with, extended” if ever his year of
plebedom will roll by. What are those unintelligible
remarks? It is some time before he understands
that the above expressions mean that
Cadet Ducrot is taking a young lady to the hop,
and that Cadet Dumbguard also, except that the
latter’s girl lives at some distance so that he is
allowed ten minutes more after the conclusion of
the dance to escort the young lady to her home.
Today, as I stroll by the camp in the evening and
see the same scenes reënacted, I re-live the first
impressions of my own plebe days.</p>

<p>Often while I was waiting my turn to go on post,
I sat fascinated as I watched the scene at the
guard tents in the twilight of the summer evenings.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
From the obscurity of the camp, stalwart figures
were constantly coming. Their gray coats and
the evening mists merged into one so completely,
it seemed as if only animated pairs of white trousers
were flitting across the parade, all converging
toward Post No. 1. Little by little, as they
approached the light of the guard tent, the rays
that were stabbing the darkness illumined the bell
buttons of the gray coats, and for a brief moment
gleaming forms with happy laughing faces filled
the picture and then into the darkness of the
Plain quickly disappeared.</p>

<p>Such reveries, however, are usually interrupted
by a sharp voice calling:</p>

<p>“Turn out the second relief!” “Hurry up, you
plebes,” and away the novitiates scamper to perform
their first guard tour. As the relief marches
around the graveled paths under the command of
a very military corporal, the plebe has, in spite of
his feeling of uncertainty, a sensation of pride in
being entrusted with the guard of a part of the
camp. Each time that the corporal commands
“Relief Halt No. 2!” and the rifles hit the ground
in unison, a pleasurable thrill pervades his being,
a consciousness of a certain importance. Before
very much pride can swell his breast, he is brought
back to reality by the stern corporal exclaiming,
“Wake up, Mr. Dumbguard, and come to port
arms!” or “Drag in your chin!” In goes the chin,
and the shoulders instinctively draw to the rear.
Glory was brief; humiliation reigns anew.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span></p>

<p>Then commences in earnest the lonely two hours
of marching up and down, back and forth, at the
end of which time the nine pounds of the rifle has
tripled at least. The arms ache, and legs feel as
if they would bore holes in the body.</p>

<p>The early part of the tour is filled with interest.
The animation in some company streets in contrast
to the silence in others, the occasional tinkling
of mandolins, the cries from one tent to
another, the laughter over a surreptitious bucket
of lemonade, the Y. M. C. A. phonograph, the
confusion over the wash lists, scampering cadets
noisily returning from hops and concerts&mdash;all keep
a sentinel from thinking of himself. It is not until
the three taps of the drum, when the camp is
magically plunged into obscurity and silence, that
the plebe begins to feel the monotony of his duty
and, while walking mechanically back and forth
on his post, to become introspective.</p>

<p>The stillness of the camp only accentuates his
slow nonchalant step on the path. In his imagination
the air seems to be filled with invisible spirits&mdash;the
spirits of the night that have come forth.
First he is conscious of only a few timid ones here
and there, but as the hours wear on they seem to
grow bolder and bolder, filling the surrounding atmosphere
and whispering in his ear their ghostly
messages. Each nerve becomes more alert as
he listens for the crunch, crunch, crunch of some
official step on the gravel. How vivid and eerie
seem his surroundings! The lonesome hours of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
the night strike a sympathetic chord in his sensitive
nature and the balmy stillness calls forth his
starry fancies. At this hour when his comrades
lie in their tents bewitched by sleep, the most
beguiling of enchantments, he is conscious that
another mysterious world is awakening all around
him in the solitude and silence. The air is filled
with fairies holding their imperceptible revels. He
hears the rustling of the leaves, the intermittent
chattering of the crickets, the soughing of the
breeze in the branches, as if the trees in great
distress were calling mournfully to each other.
Should this be the first time that he is alone at
night on post, he is a little afraid, and starts at the
faintest sound. It seems that when man reposes,
the <i>Things</i> come forth to their daily tasks, performed
in a world unknown to us.</p>

<p>Never will he forget, however, the ineffable
beauty of the scene, so beautiful that he is filled
with a little sadness. The buildings across the
Plain, stern and melancholy even in the darkness,
seemed to be companion sentinels ever watchful over
their traditions, and guarding the sleeping hills
dimly discernible through their misty blankets.
Occasionally a graceful river steamer, like some
huge Jack-o’-Lantern ruffling the smooth waters
of the Hudson, glides softly by under the cliff,
her throbbing engines seeming to send forth a
certain warmth that dispels the chill of the early
morning.</p>

<p>It is at this hour especially that his thoughts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
wander to his “ain Folk” and reveal to his senses
the full aroma of his days at home.</p>

<p>The clanking of a sword in the darkness calls
him back to earth and to the realization that
the dreaded inspection is at hand.</p>

<p>“Halt! Who goes there?” he quickly challenges.</p>

<p>“Corporal of the Guard,” answers a sepulchral
voice from the shadows.</p>

<p>“Advance, Corporal of the Guard, with the countersign,”
uncertainly commands the plebe. When
within whispering distance, the corporal faintly
breathes the countersign, “Saratoga,” or “Burgoyne”
(or maybe Tannhäuser or Dumbguard,
to test the sentinel), whereupon the corporal is
allowed to pass by the sentinel’s order:</p>

<p>“Advance, Corporal of the Guard.”</p>

<p>In the eyes of the yearling corporal, a plebe is
habitually wrong, so that for a few trying minutes
the benighted sentinel endeavors to “take charge
of his post and all government property in view,”
while his preceptor picks him to pieces, his bearing,
his accoutrements, his knowledge, admonishing
him at intervals, to “Drag in his chin&mdash;way in.”
But soon, the solitude of the night begins to work
even upon the yearling corporal constraining him
to indulge in a partial intimacy with the plebe,
adding in softened tones:</p>

<p>“Mister, where are you from?”</p>

<p>“South Carolina, sir,” proudly responds the sentinel,
touched by the upper-classman’s near-cordiality.</p>

<p>With a gruff “Pretty fine State, mister,” the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
corporal virtuously departs to interrogate his next
victim.</p>

<p>How welcome now is the first faint tread of the
relief as it makes its bi-hourly round to take the
sleepy sentinel back to the guard tent where a bed
of camp stools awaits his aching muscles.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The tour of guard of a new cadet is sometimes
made uncomfortable by the pranks of the upper-classmen,
although since the abolition of hazing
at West Point, this form of diversion has greatly
diminished. The regulations against hazing have
been made so stringent that few cadets indulge in
the practice. As a matter of fact hazing no longer
exists at the Military Academy. A few heedless
chaps from time to time, forgetful of the future,
unconscious of the heartburns that they will suffer
later on, indulge in hazing the plebes, but they
pay the price for their fun. Formerly, hazing
was tolerated among the cadets because some
of its features were not harmful or objectionable,
but, as in all cases where a little liberty is granted
to lads of immature judgment, license followed.
The practice was carried too far and moderation
ceased to exist. In 1901, at the instance of a
former cadet’s parents, Congress ordered an investigation
of hazing conditions, with the result
that the Superintendent was directed to abolish
all semblance of mistreatment of plebes by upper-classmen.</p>

<p>The more vicious practices disappeared at once,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
but from time to time investigation revealed isolated
cases of the innocent kind. In the days of
hazing, the favorite and most injurious punishment
meted out to a plebe, if he were at all fresh,
or “B. J.” as the cadets say, was a series of exercises
known as “eagles.” The new man would be
taken in a tent, stripped to the waist, and compelled
to execute a setting-up exercise, “Full bend
knees.” The knees are separated and bent as
much as possible; point of knees forced forward and
downward, heels together; trunk and head erect;
but instead of placing the hands on the hips, he was
required to raise the arms laterally. It is not the
exercise itself that was injurious, but the duration
of the punishment. Some men were required to
“eagle” 100 or 150 times without a rest, and if
they had committed a particularly heinous offense,
this physical rebuke was administered under the
broiling sun in the “catacombs.” Another form of
punishment consisted in making plebes, stripped
to the waist, hold pieces of matches or tissue paper,
between their shoulder blades for half an hour or
more, while their tormentors stood around insisting
that they flatten their chins to their necks.</p>

<p>But this punishment was not viewed by the plebes
with as much dismay as was the servitude to “Tabasco
Sauce.” The prowling yearlings would descend
into the Fourth Class sink, line up the plebes,
and order them to stick out their tongues, upon
which they dashed a flop or two of the burning
liquid and fled. Sometimes, at the Mess Hall, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
much as half a teaspoonful was meted out for some
unconscious transgression by the plebe of the upper-classmen’s
wishes. Fortunately the above practices
have long since disappeared.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the greater part of the
hazing consisted of what is known at college as
“fagging,” such as dragging water, sweeping
tents, making beds, cleaning brasses and rifles,
making lemonade, running errands, sewing buttons
on white trousers, etc. Each upper-classman
selected a plebe for his “special duty man” to
perform the aforementioned tasks. Most of the
plebes did the duty cheerfully, buoyed up by the
thought that next year their turn to have a plebe
would arrive. A large part of the hazing, moreover,
was the so-called “deviling” the plebes, a
generic term applied to all kinds of humorous and
mischievous pranks. Any cadet, for example, who
possessed any peculiarity of size, appearance, or temperament
was given a “tech” or technical name, to
be used always in lieu of his own. One of my classmates,
whose tent was in a part of the camp called
“Paradise Alley,” was given in consequence of his
auburn hair the following “tech” with strict instructions
to use it no matter who asked him his
name. In reply, therefore, to the same inquiry,
“Who are you?” many times daily, he scrupulously
replied:</p>

<p>“I am a too-loo-loo bird, sir! Peep-y-ty-peep,
sir! Poop-y-ty-poop! Ah! ... there. I’m the
sunshine of Paradise Alley, sir; I am a queen, sir.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
My hair is sky-blue pink with a heavenly border,
sir! Don’t you think I’m handsome, sir? I don’t
give a damn, sir!”</p>

<p>This “tech” became famous, the peep-y-ty-peep
part fastening itself upon him as a nickname. Of
course, all of these pranks were carried on <i>sub
rosa</i> and presumedly without the sanction or knowledge
of the authorities. One night, however, the
cadet was detailed for guard for the first time.
It happened that his tour of duty was from 2 <small>A.M.</small>
to 4 <small>A.M.</small>, those awful hours of the night. “Peep-y-ty-peep”
was patrolling his post ready to charge
anything that came along. Suddenly the huge
shadow of a cavalry Tactical officer with a rattling
saber and jingling spurs loomed out of the darkness.
Frantically “Peep-y-ty-peep” charged down the
post screaming, “Halt! Halt! who’s thar?” (in good
old Alabama English), until most of the sleeping
cadets in the vicinity of the post were awakened.
After a few minutes of backing and filling the massive
cavalry officer arrived in front of the now
thoroughly bewildered “sunshine of Paradise Alley,”
and began to ask him his orders. Poor old
“Peep-y-ty-peep” forgot them all, general and special.
After vain, fruitless efforts to obtain an expression
of opinion of some sort from the sentinel,
this officer said in desperation: “Who are you, anyway?”
Whereupon perfectly seriously the rooky
sentinel cried at the top of his voice, while the nearby
tents shook with laughter, “I’m a too-loo-loo bird,
sir! Peep-y-ty-peep, sir! Poop-y-ty-poop, sir! Ah...!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
there. I’m the sunshine of Paradise Alley, sir!
I’m&mdash;” The Tactical officer hurriedly disappeared.</p>

<p>Such incidents as the above kept the plebes from
becoming too depressed. The fun of the upper-classmen
found many other outlets. On days
when watermelons were served in the Mess Hall,
the plebes were required at the conclusion of
the meal to fill their mouths with seeds, and
thus loaded to the gunwales to march back to
camp. The wriggling, squirming, slippery little
black particles fought with one another to burst
open the encircling mouth <i>en cul de poule</i> and
leap to freedom, and occasionally their efforts
were successful, on the march back to camp, to
the detriment of the blouse of the plebe’s front
rank file. More frequently, however, upon arrival
at camp, the plebes of A Co. were lined up at six
paces from those of B Co., and at a given signal
the human machine guns belched forth their
glossy black bullets. One upper-classman ordered
me to gather a handful from the battlefield and
plant them around his tent. To my dismay and
chagrin they sprouted, whereupon I was instructed
to care for them, keep them in health or sickness,
and train the growing vines on slender cords.</p>

<p>The plebes were hardly allowed a moment to themselves.
Every spare moment was employed in cleaning
guns, brasses and other equipment, chiefly of
upper-classmen for whom one happened to be
a “special duty man.” If some unoffending sparrows
alighted in the company streets, half a dozen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
yearling voices rang out, “Turn out, you plebes, and
chase those eagles!” Lads in all sorts and conditions
of undress fell precipitately out of their tents,
bayonets in hand, to drive away the innocent feathered
marauders. If an upper-classman wished to
know the time, he would yell, “<i>Quelle heure est-il?</i>”
a whole chorus replied, “Two o’clock, sir!” Again,
every plebe was required upon inquiry to give his
P. C. S., or previous condition of servitude. Those
who had none, never having worked in their lives,
were made to answer “schoolgirl,” as a mark of immaturity
and unworldliness. Never was a plebe
permitted to say: “I don’t know.” “Say something,
Mr. Dumbguard,” was the admonishment
followed by: “If you cannot think of anything, say
‘steamboat’! Never say that you don’t know!”</p>

<p>I once stood behind a man in ranks who weighed,
he said, 190 pounds. I weighed but 120. It became
my daily duty to weigh and report to him
how much of his frail body I, as his near rank file,
left uncovered and exposed to the elements. When
a plebe was on guard at night, some of the yearlings
would appear on his post covered with sheets
which they fluttered at a great rate.</p>

<p>“Halt! Who goes there?” cries the sentinel.</p>

<p>“A flock of angels,” was the reply, and before
the sentinel could get the corporal of the guard,
the flock had flown.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>pièce de résistance</i> of the camp was, however,
a rat funeral for which elaborate preparations were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
made. Efforts for days were exerted to catch a
rat or a mouse, but if neither could be beguiled
into the trap, a grasshopper served the purpose.
In a plebe’s tent an imposing catafalque, equal to
that prepared for any crowned head, was constructed
of wooden lockers covered with black
rubber ponchos. Upon the top of this bier surrounded
by candles was Mr. Rat.</p>

<p>During the night preceding the obsequies a
guard of honor of the plebes, fantastically dressed,
kept a running watch over the fast-stiffening
rodent. Next day, after drill, came the funeral.
Orders were issued by the upper-classmen for all
plebes to attend and for those having musical
instruments to appear with them. One plebe was
detailed to act as chaplain and prepare the funeral
oration, another as leader of the band, another as
chief mourner. The remainder of the plebes were
the afflicted relatives whose weeds were the most
bizarre and fantastic costumes that they could
create. In the procession, therefore, were plebes
in underdrawers and dress coats buttoned in the
rear, hats reversed, breeches with no shoes, shoes
without breeches, ponchos over nature only, and
sometimes <i>in puris naturalibus</i>. Each mourner,
moreover, came with a galvanized bucket to catch
his tears.</p>

<p>First appeared the band composed of mandolins
and guitars, a stray violin, and perhaps a lonely
cornet, followed by the deceased borne upon a
canvas stretcher strewn with dandelions. To the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
tune of Chopin’s funeral march, the grotesquely
arrayed mourners followed the bier, chanting
from time to time a parody written for the music
and entitled “Somebody Hit Me with a Codfish
Ball!” At a signal from the chief mourner the
cortège halted to allow the plebes to deliver themselves
with abandon to their grief. By order,
they raised the galvanized buckets to catch the
“tears that stopped the flood-gates of their eyes,”
while they filled the air with agonized mournings
and lamentations. If the sobbing and blubbering
appeared too faint, the upper-classmen who lined
the route increased the wailings by yelling, “Weep
louder, you plebes!”</p>

<p>At the grave, somewhere in the rear of the camp,
the “chaplain,” “Daddy” Singles, spoke feelingly
of the departed one’s nobility of soul. The gnawing
grief of the multitude gave way once more to
despair (and usually to laughter) as they lowered
into the ground poor old Mr. Rat, whose rigid
whiskers gave him an amused expression, as if he
were enjoying his honorable end.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After two months’ training in camp, the cadets
return to barracks to begin their academic duties.
At once, all nonsense ceases, and the new cadet
is in no wise interfered with, even in fun. The
routine changes completely and the day becomes
fuller. Reveille is a half hour later, but the work
increases and there are fewer leisure moments.</p>

<p>It is to the more serious and inexorable side of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
his training that the cadet must now turn. Life in
barracks is more sedate, more formal, more cold
than the free existence of camp where he and his
comrades were living close to Nature. The time
has arrived to renounce the pleasure of sleeping in
the open, of breathing the fragrant out-of-doors,
of living in the midst of scenery that appeals to
every æsthetic faculty. It is in the rooms of barracks
that the next nine months must be passed,
the severe unadorned rooms whose bareness, however,
is forgotten in the ineffable sweetness of the
friendship of one’s roommate. At no place, perhaps,
are closer friendships formed than at West Point.
They are not of the whirlwind kind so common
elsewhere today, that sweep one off his feet for the
time being. Nor are they like some great roaring
wind that shakes one’s nature to its depths and
then leaves him bruised and torn, but wide awake
at last, to spend its force in other directions.
Rather are they friendships of slower growth, but
deep and sincere, belonging more to a mature age
than to the irresponsible years of a cadet when his
enthusiasm, his likes and dislikes, seem to be the
only things necessary to foster.</p>

<p>The difficulties of his studies, the homesickness,
the fatigue of the drills, the irksomeness of the
routine, are all lightened by the intimacy with his
chum, by the smile of sympathy, or the word of
encouragement that greets him at all times. It
is a great privilege to live in close contact with a
human being and be allowed a glimpse into his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
soul. It compensates for all the stony paths of
life, for all hardships, and sends one forth to his
duties with a feeling of joy and gladness, strong in
heart and thankful to God.</p>

<p>In every room in barracks dwell two chums,
each the “wife” of the other. The increased
number of cadets and the negligence of Congress
to provide extra barracks have caused the introduction
of Mormonism, for in some rooms are
three chums, each with <i>two</i> “wives.”</p>

<p>The most striking feature about the rooms is
their plainness. Here the cadet is “allowed not
more than nature needs,” or scarcely more, for an
inventory of the furniture discloses two iron cots,
one iron washstand, two plain wooden tables,
two wooden chairs, and two steel clothespresses.
The walls and floors are bare, for the Regulations
prohibit rugs, carpets, pictures, placards, banners,
or any other adornment. Upon the plain black
iron mantel in the middle is a mirror, flanked by
black tin frames containing the hours of instruction
and a time schedule designed to indicate at all
times the whereabouts of the occupants of the
room. Not to have the hours of instruction
correctly posted is a military offense. No matter
where the cadet is, at recitation, barber shop,
church, lecture, hospital, library, his card must so
indicate. In addition, a small inexpensive clock
may be kept on the mantel.</p>

<p>To give each occupant of the room a little
privacy, a wooden partition juts out half way
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
into the room dividing this space into two alcoves,
in which are placed the cots. During the day
the mattresses are folded and upon them the
bedding is piled. Only during release from
quarters, and after 9:00 <small>P.M.</small>, are the beds allowed
to be made down and used. Along the sides
of each alcove are hooks for the clothing, which
must be hung in a prescribed manner; for example,
1st hook, raincoat; 2d hook, overcoats; 3d,
sweater coat, and so on. The shoes are aligned
toes out, along the side of the bed, in a definite
order, the high overshoes as right guide, then
the low overshoes, and other shoes according to
height.</p>

<p>Upon the top of the clothespress are the books,
arranged according to height, newspapers, periodicals,
stationery, cameras, and tobacco. In the
shelf section each of the various articles of clothing
has a prescribed place, and in the coat section the
uniforms are hung in a regular order. Only
on the top shelf of the clothespress may the cadet
keep a photograph.</p>

<p>In front of and against the alcove partition is
the washstand with its two wash bowls. The
water, hot and cold, is drawn from a hydrant in the
hall. This arrangement is a great luxury in comparison
with the old days when, to heat water for
shaving, we poured it over a joint in the radiator.</p>

<p>In barracks as in camp there is a room orderly
who is responsible for the condition, cleanliness,
and general police of all parts of the room. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
cadets sweep their own rooms and make their own
beds. The halls are swept by the civilian policemen,
who also scrub periodically the floors of both
rooms and halls. By Regulations, cadets are not
allowed valets, nor are they permitted to own an
automobile, horse, or dog.</p>

<p>The cadets are in uniform, of course, at all times.
Every detail of their clothing is prescribed. The
collars, for example, must project above the coat
collar just one eighth of an inch, and a like display
of cuff is required. Only certain kinds of
shoes may be worn, and certain kinds of gloves
both for drills and hops. Although not prescribed
by Regulations, a custom of long standing among
the cadets prohibits the plebes from wearing their
overcoats with the end of the capes thrown back
over the shoulder, nor may they wear lisle thread
gloves to chapel, but must content themselves with
the thick, coarse Berlin gun glove. The lowered
capes of the plebes give them an air of humility
alongside of the upper-classmen, and the gun
gloves accentuate the crudity of the poor plebe’s
military appearance.</p>

<p>The day is filled with duties. From the return
of the Battalion from breakfast until 8:00 <small>A.M.</small>, is
a study period. From 8:00 <small>A.M.</small> until 12:35
<small>P.M.</small>, the different classes attend recitations in the
prescribed courses, or perhaps have instruction
in gymnastic exercises or in riding. Dinner
comes at 12:40 <small>P.M.</small>, after which recitations are
held until 3:50 <small>P.M.</small> In the fall and spring drills
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
commence at 4:00 <small>P.M.</small>, followed by parade at 5:30
<small>P.M.</small>, and retreat and supper at 6:30 <small>P.M.</small></p>

<p>Cadets do not proceed individually to their
classrooms, but are formed in the area of barracks
in sections, under the command of a section
marcher, who, after reporting to the officer of
the day any absentees, marches his men to their
section rooms.</p>

<p>In like manner there is a meal formation. The
Battalions are formed in front of barracks and
marched by the two senior captains to the Mess
Hall. Just as much observance to step, alignment,
and bearing is required as though marching to
parade.</p>

<p>Upon entering the hall, “at ease” is commanded,
whereupon the cadets proceed quietly to their
places at table and remain standing back of their
chairs until the cadet captain commands: “A
Co., take seats.” The food is always ready so
there is no delay. Thirty minutes are allowed for
breakfast and supper, and forty for dinner.</p>

<p>As soon as seated, cadets begin to talk and
laugh. The only restriction upon them is that
they must conduct themselves at mess like young
gentlemen. No throwing of food or waste is
tolerated. One first-classman, known as the table
commandant, is in charge of each table and is held
responsible for all breaches of regulations upon the
part of the cadets thereat.</p>

<p>Civilian waiters bring the food from the kitchen
and place it upon the table. The cadets are then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
required to help themselves. Custom makes the
three or four plebes at each table perform the most
onerous duties. One plebe, known as the “water
corporal” pours the water and milk. Another,
the “meat corporal,” carves the “bone,” and
another, the “gunner,” pours the coffee, and
exercises a general supervision over the supply.
Their duties keep them very busy, for the upper-classmen
constantly demand food.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_154" src="images/i_154.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Marching to Barracks from Dinner</p>

<p class="copy">The Academic Buildings</p></div>

<p>The life at the Mess Hall is replete with customs,
and the vocabulary of the cadets filled with terms
unintelligible to the uninitiated. Some of their
customs would not be approved in polite society
but would be, perhaps, by modern efficiency.
If, for example, a man at the end of the table wishes
more water or milk, bang! goes his glass on the
table preliminary to its flight through the air to
the outstretched nervous hands of the “water
corporal.” The plebe eats in spasms, so to speak,
one eye on his food, and the other on the alert for
aërial glasses.</p>

<p>“How’s the cow?” yells an upper-classman,
meaning how much milk is in the pitcher.</p>

<p>“Almost dry, sir!” replies the plebe.</p>

<p>“Milk her again!” is commanded as the glass
comes speeding down.</p>

<p>Every morning the “gunner” who sits at the end
of the table, in capacity of hostess, so to speak,
“sounds off” the number of days until June.
Instead of grace, he commences the meal, “282
days until June, sir!” On the 300th, 200th, 100th
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
day before June, the plebes write speeches in which
they are allowed great latitude in satirizing the
upper-classmen. The yearling who has been
particularly annoying during the year sees all
of his faults held up to ridicule, but he must
swallow his medicine at the hands of the plebe.</p>

<p>It is a real treat to see the men at mess. No
melancholy stillness pervades the Mess Hall.
One can hardly hear himself in the din of rattling
dishes, knives, forks, the peals of laughter, the
roar of eight hundred voices all talking at once,
punctuated by the plebes repeatedly shrieking,
“Bread! please!” or whatever they want. In
beholding them, one realizes vividly the meaning
of the expression “teeming with life.”</p>

<p>Occasionally, orders are read in the Mess Hall by
the Adjutant. It would seem impossible to get the
attention of the cadets, but when he commands:</p>

<p>“Bát-tál-yón ... at-ten-tion!” the roar almost
instantly subsides, like a balloon suddenly pierced.
A wave of silence engulfs the hall, accentuated at
times by the fall of a fork or spoon on the tiled
floor. Quietly the cadets sit, as the Adjutant
reads his order, on “skins” (delinquencies).
There are no soft notes in his tone. They are all
fortissimo and run together until they become
“monotonous,” like the hum of a factory. Some
mischievous cadet, unable to bear the enforced
inactivity, enlivens a small group around him by
stealthily firing a bread ball at an unobserving
neighbor.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span></p>

<p>Each cadet has a silver napkin ring with his
name and class inscribed thereon. At graduation
all of the rings are melted into a loving cup which is
given to the member of the class who has the first
son. This child is known as the “Class boy.”</p>

<p>Just before the conclusion of the meal the first
captain makes an inspection, calls the Mess Hall
to attention, and commands: “1st Battalion,
rise.” The cadets file out quietly, form in front
of the Mess Hall, and return to their barracks.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The rooms are subjected to a continual series of
inspections. First, there is a rather superficial inspection
by the subdivision inspectors, cadets of the
First Class, twenty minutes after reveille. They
give the rooms a <i>coup d’œil</i> chiefly to see that
the floors have been swept and the bedding folded
and piled. During the forenoon, the Tactical
officer in charge of the company makes a careful
survey of everything. This is known as the
“Tac” inspection, and may occur any time
from 8:00 <small>A.M.</small> to 11:00 <small>A.M.</small> Until the “Tac”
makes his morning visit the cadets are required
to wear their uniforms buttoned. The majority
of the cadets sit around in their sweater coats
until they hear the authoritative knock of the
“Tac” on the doors of the first-floor rooms. They
then quickly don their blouses until after he leaves,
when sweaters are again brought forth. This
time is a study period and it is almost impossible
to concentrate on problems that make you feel
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
like tearing your hair, when dressed in a tight-fitting
uniform.</p>

<p>When roommates attend morning recitations at
different periods, the first-hour men are notified
of the inspection by their comrades who leave the
mirror turned to the wall as a signal, or, sometimes,
just a sign&mdash;“He has.” Once a Tactical officer
with a sense of humor traced in the dust across
the face of a cadet’s mirror, during his absence,
“He has.”</p>

<p>Upon the return from first-hour recitations the
divisions ring with shouts, “Has he?” “Has he?”
mingled with the cries to the plebe mail carrier of,
“Mr. Dumbguard, has the mail?”</p>

<p>After dinner the officer of the day inspects to see
that the cadets are not visiting and that the rooms
are in order. During the evening study periods,
from about 7:30 to 9:30 <small>P.M.</small>, the cadet sentinels
posted in the halls of barracks inspect three times.
They open the doors of each room, inquiring,
“All right, sir?” whereupon the occupants reply,
“All right, sir!” or “Cadet Ducrot is absent.”
The reply “All right” signifies that all occupants
are present, or if any are absent that their absence
is authorized. Any cadet who intentionally makes
an incorrect report is dismissed from the Academy.</p>

<p>The day ends, as it begins, with an inspection
of the subdivision inspectors. At the three taps
of the drum in the Area, cries of “Lights out!” fill
the air. The buildings are plunged into darkness
except for a dim hall light, and the inspectors,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
armed with bull’s-eye lanterns, flit through the
halls like nervous fireflies. Each door is hurriedly
opened; a beam of light seeks first one bed then the
next, while the dark form on the threshold calls out
sharply, “All in?” “All in, sir!” replies the room
orderly from the depths of the alcove. Bang!
goes the door and the shadow disappears. From
all the divisions the fireflies swarm into the Area
and align themselves like a string of shining beads
in front of the officer of the day to whom they
report.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For all breaches of regulations the cadets are
reported, “skinned” in their parlance. The list
of delinquencies is read out at retreat, and the next
morning the cadet must submit a written explanation
of the offense. The majority of the reports
are for minor offenses, such as lates, absences, inattention,
buttons off uniform, and so on. Ordinarily,
no explanation for these offenses is requested,
although the cadet has a right to offer one if he so
desires. The more serious offenses, however, must
be explained.</p>

<p>In their explanations cadets must confine their
statements to plain facts. No criticism or argumentation
is allowed. Occasionally some wit
transcends the limit and amuses himself for the
moment at the expense of his conduct grade.
Once a report was entered against a cadet for having
worn his night-shirt to the Drawing Academy.
It seems that, lacking a plain white shirt, he hastily
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
donned a night-shirt, stuffing the flowing tails in
his trousers. He was betrayed, however, by the
blue embroidery down the front. An instructor,
seeing the queer garment, reported the cadet. Since
he had been obliged to attend a number of lectures
in drawing, at which he invariably fell asleep, he
submitted the following facetious explanation to
the Commandant of Cadets:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:</p>

<p>In explanation of the report “wearing a night-shirt
to the Drawing Academy on the 10th inst.” I
have the honor to state that I heard that there was to
be a lecture in drawing; consequently, I wore my
night-shirt.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I need not add that he walked a number of
punishment tours for his wit.</p>

<p>The punishments that may be awarded a cadet
are:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>(<i>a</i>)</td>
    <td>Confinements; that is, restriction to room during release from quarters.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td />
    <td>Restriction of limits.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td />
    <td>Deprivation of privileges.</td>

    <td>Reprimands.</td>

  <tr>
    <td />
    <td>Reduction of officers or non-commissioned officers to the grade of private.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td />
    <td>Loss of furlough.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>(<i>b</i>)</td>
    <td>Suspension.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td />
    <td>Dismissal.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span></p>

<p>Punishment tours are of one-hour duration, during
which time the cadet walks an assigned beat.
On Wednesday and Saturday afternoons the Area
is filled with cadets walking to and fro, like pendulums,
each tracing in the gravel a little path. They
resemble in their animation the goings and comings
of a colony of ants. No cadet enjoys walking
tours. It is viewed as a particularly disagreeable
punishment, much worse than serving a confinement
in one’s room, where he may “bone fiction,”
chasing away the gloom of imprisonment with
some interesting book. In the winter months
the chill and snow fill their thoughts and hearts
as they pace to and fro, beating their hands together
for warmth. But it is in the autumn and
spring when the athletic contests with outside
teams take place that the misery of walking tours
becomes terribly acute. The cheering of the
fortunate cadets witnessing the games is like some
magnet which draws and draws. The longing
must be resisted and stifled while they continue
upon their monotonous walk, chained to an
inexorable task.</p>

<p>The work demanded of a cadet is hard, but
without the restrictions, obstacles, the petty
annoyances, the young plebe that comes to West
Point so plastic and yielding would never grow and
develop. At first the limitations that surround
him baffle and bewilder him for a time, but as the
days pass by and he begins to be imbued with the
spirit of the Corps, and to feel the traditions and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
atmosphere of West Point, he insensibly rises
superior to every annoying restriction. He may
indulge in occasional grumbling and ill-humor but
what of that? He knows now that a reason exists
for every obstacle, and he sees in the hardships
a way that leads to the development of his higher
self. His moral force is gradually crystallized
and he gains the spirit of willingness to do his
duty toward the Academy and his little bit in keeping
strong the spirit of West Point.</p>

<p>The main idea of West Point after all is to develop
the mind and character of the cadet, to instill
into him the proper ideas of discipline. It does
not aim for a discipline where a man’s spirit or will
is broken, so that he obeys through fear, but a
discipline of the soul, wherein a cadet performs
his duty for the deed’s sake. Without this high
moral spirit, no army can be successful, despite
the most brilliant galaxy of officers.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span></p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />

<span class="large">THE DISCIPLINE OF THE MIND</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> longer a cadet remains at West Point,
the clearer and finer becomes his point of
view. During the first few months of his career,
a glimpse of which we had in the previous chapter,
he is so busy learning the mechanism of the drills,
the care of his person and equipment, and familiarizing
himself with all of the strange names and
unusual customs of military life that his point of
view is more or less clouded.</p>

<p>Little by little, during the summer encampment,
as soon as the newness of his surroundings begins to
wear away, he finds himself undergoing a change of
heart; he experiences a new feeling and appreciation
of his work and a sort of exhilaration of
discovering the progress that he is making in his
daily tasks. For example, instead of going out to
parade in a dazed and mechanical manner, he
marches forth filled with pride that he is really
a member of so <i>élite</i> a Corps. He strives to do his
bit with all his might. He lends a close attention to
all commands so that no act of his will mar the
appearance of his company, and does his utmost to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
assume the correct position of a soldier that is
incessantly dinned into his ears by the ever alert
file closers. He feels that he is changing, but does
not understand just how. In reality his point
of view is swinging around, it is clearing up, and
the new cadet is beginning to be animated with the
spirit of West Point.</p>

<p>The scales seem to drop from his eyes. He is no
longer concerned so completely with his troubles
and difficulties, with his inability to get into his
white trousers without mussing them badly, with
his capacity for doing “wooden” things, or with
all of the thousand and one little heartburns for
things done and left undone.</p>

<p>On the contrary, the incidents of his surroundings
that are unrelated to himself begin to interest
him. With quiet amusement he watches the antics
of the yearlings, envying them their careless
nonchalant air. His heart goes out in sympathy
to some fellow plebe who has just incurred
the displeasure of an upper-classman. He secretly
admires the military bearing of the cadet officers,
the fit of their blouses, their erect and graceful
carriage. To him they represent the ideal in the
flesh toward which he is striving. There is a
certain something about the manner in which
they perform their duties that inspires the plebe
to extra efforts. In the hope of receiving a word
of praise from the cadet captain at inspection
before parade, an extra rub is given to the rifle
or breastplate, and more care is taken in climbing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
into those stiff white trousers. He listens with the
greatest interest to the chatter about the approaching
Academic term and accepts with gratitude the
counsels sometimes offered him by the cadet
captain.</p>

<p>As the camp draws to a close, not only the captain
but all of the upper-classmen give the plebe
gratuitous advice about the coming Academic
year. At every formation while awaiting the
sounding of the assembly, little groups gather in
the company streets and interrogate the plebes
as to their previous mental training. A note of
restlessness begins to pervade the camp as the
month of September draws nigh. Once again the
books must be taken down from the shelves and
hours of study devoted to the solution of problems.</p>

<p>The plebe views the close of the camp with a
sigh of relief mingled with not a little anxiety. It
is true that he is glad to get into barracks where
he will have a little more personal liberty, and
be free from the incessant drilling, drilling. On
the other hand, the opening of the Academic year
fills him with some misgivings about his ability
to master the studies and fulfill his ambition to become
an officer.</p>

<p>Before he is really aware of the flight of the days,
September the first has arrived. He leaves the
life of camp where almost the entire day has been
devoted to military exercises of one sort or another
and plunges into the Academic work. A new
sort of life begins and the routine of the day
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
is readjusted. With determination he sets out to
climb the stony path of knowledge that alone will
lead him to his commission. The branch of the
service that he will eventually select is as yet
unknown to him, but as he proceeds in his career
at the Academy he will have a taste of the duties
of each arm, and he will later on be able to choose
his branch with intelligence.</p>

<p>The beauty about the West Point system of
training officers is that it educates them for all
branches of the Army, for the line and for the staff.
When a man graduates, he is assigned either to
the Corps of Engineers, the Ordnance, Artillery,
Cavalry, or Infantry according to his choice based
on his class standing. The highest men usually
select the Corps of Engineers, although it is not
unusual for a man who is recommended for the
Engineers by the Academic Board to choose some
branch of the mobile Army.</p>

<p>The curriculum to which our young cadet must
devote nine months of the year is highly scientific
and technical. The corner-stone of the course is
mathematics, and the great mass of the structure
is made up of the exact sciences. Primarily,
the curriculum is designed to give the cadet a liberal
education and to turn out a man with
sharpened mental processes. It does not lay the
greatest emphasis upon the training of cadets in
the practical duties that pertain to any particular
arm or corps. The reasons for this are very sound.</p>

<p>It is the belief of all officers who have given the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
question of military education any thoughtful
study that the first requisite of any army is a corps
of officers trained in the essentials of their profession.
What really does this mean? It simply
means that officers of the Army should be well
educated men, not only those who are to go into
the technical branches such as the Engineers and
the Ordnance, but the line officers as well. The
authorities at West Point have therefore developed
a broad scientific course, fully convinced that the
mental discipline, powers of investigation, and
accurate reasoning necessary in solving problems
in the exact sciences are the same mental qualities
that are needed whether in planning a great
campaign, building a Panama Canal, or fighting
the savage Moro in the distant Philippines.</p>

<p>The advisability of giving all cadets, those
destined for the line as well as for the staff, the
same education has been questioned more than
once. As long ago as 1843, a Board of Officers,
of which General Scott was president, made
certain criticisms of the course of instruction. It
is interesting to quote the answer made by the
Academic Board, for the ideas set forth therein
express in general the opinions held today:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Academic Board believes that one of the most
important objects of the Academy is to subject each
cadet, previous to his promotion to a higher grade in
the Army, to a thorough course of mental as well as
military discipline to teach him to reason readily and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
accurately to apply right principles to cases of daily
occurrence in the life of a soldier. They are satisfied
that a strict course of mathematical and philosophical
study, with applications to the various branches of
military science, is by far the best calculated to bring
about this end, and that the present scientific course
at the Academy, the result of the experience of many
years, is in its main feature such a course.</p>

<p>They are aware that many of the cadets, as is the
case with most of those who pursue a scientific course
at other institutions, will have little occasion to make
practical applications of the many mathematical
problems that they meet, and that they may have
passed over certain problems without thoroughly understanding
their meaning in all their points. Still, if
the course has been thoroughly taught, the reasoning
faculties will have been strongly exercised and disciplined
and a system of habit and thought acquired
which is invaluable in the pursuit of any profession,
and as desirable for the infantry or dragoon officer
as for any other officer in the service. The officer
whose mind has thus been disciplined and who is not
forgetful of the duty he owes to the government that
has furnished him with opportunities so valuable, will
acquire facts and information in whatever station the
interests of the service may place him. This discipline
and system he will learn at an early age only, and
nowhere so well as during his term of service at the
Academy.</p></blockquote>

<p>In recent years, strong influences have been
brought to bear on the Academy to change the
course so as to make it more practical. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
advocates of this change ignore the ends toward
which West Point’s course works, heretofore
successfully, and desire to see cadets leave West
Point with what they call a practical knowledge of
the different arms. This means that they wish
the graduated cadet to join his regiment well
versed in the routine work of the Army, and would
have West Point take precious time from mental
training to teach a more complete knowledge
of the mechanism of the drills. If West Point
followed this advice, the graduated cadet would
have a difficult road in solving the big problems
that will arise in his career. If in the West Point
course emphasis were laid upon the practical
work rather than upon the intellectual training,
then the cadet would simply be storing up knowledge
instead of learning how to think. When
therefore any situation would arise, the tendency
would be to make a requisition upon the storehouse
for a solution. If there is no similar situation
tucked away on the shelves of memory, that
will serve as a guide, he will in many cases be at
a loss how to proceed. Not so, however, if his
mind has been trained correctly. He will work
out his own solution.</p>

<p>Many people believe that the whole science
of the military profession is embraced in a book of
drill regulations whose practical demonstration on
the drill and parade grounds constitutes all that is
necessary to make a successful officer. They do
not realize that battles are won first with the brain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
and then with the sword. They rather regard the
work of officers much the same as manual labor
that anyone can do, and they do not admit that
any great amount of mental training for the
officers is necessary.</p>

<p>I do not wish to give the impression that there is
no practical training at the Academy&mdash;far from it.
But I am glad to say that it has been allotted its
proper place in the course. Once the theory is
mastered, the practical is quickly learned afterwards.
Any cadet with a trained mind can readily
learn the practical duties that may be demanded
of him as an officer.</p>

<p>It is an astonishing fact that I have heard West
Point methods criticised in the Army because
a young graduate upon joining his regiment did
not know how to make out a <i>morning report</i>! Why
should he? The fact that any boy of average
intelligence can learn to make one out in fifteen
minutes should be a complete answer to all demands
that cadets should be taught these trivialities
at the Academy.</p>

<p>The criticism leveled at West Point by officers
of the Army is unjust. Older officers expect too
much of the graduated cadet. I have noticed that
they demand of these young men, immediately
upon joining, the same mature conception and
efficient execution of certain duties as they themselves
are able to display only after years of
experience.</p>

<p>Upon graduation from West Point, I dare say
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
that there is no more highminded, well-trained, and
efficient body of young men in the world. The
graduates join their commands brimming over with
youth, intelligence, enthusiasm, and energy and
ruled by intense loyalty. They want to do what is
right. They want to go forward in their profession.
They make every effort to perform well their
duties. All that they need are leaders among their
superiors who will develop their aspirations.
Sometimes they encounter a distinct air of hostility,
occasionally a petty attitude on the part of some
older officers whose one ambition is to “put them
in their place,” and, too frequently, simply indifference.
The result is that the young officers quickly
become a prey to the red tape, the dull routine, the
narrowness of post life, or to the mental inertia
of prolonged duty upon the border where almost
every stimulating influence is absent. If only
there were enough good leaders to take this wonderful
material that the Academy sends forth annually
and develop it, there is no telling to what
heights these young officers would rise.</p>

<p>But to return to our plebe who makes his début
in Academic work September the first. The
evening before has been spent in earnest preparation
for the lesson in mathematics, and he sets
forth on this early autumn day to grapple with the
hardest study of his course.</p>

<p>First call for recitation is sounded at seven
minutes before eight o’clock. The trumpeter, an
enlisted man of the Army, blows “school call”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
first in the area of barracks, then outside of the
north sally-port, on the Plain side of the buildings.
The call is repeated several times, and as its notes
float out on the air, the barracks begin to disgorge
the cadets, sometimes singly, but more often in
groups of twos and threes. The more prompt ones
pile out on the cement walk, standing near their
places in the ranks to await the assembly. The
majority are laughing and talking or discussing the
lesson, while others, thirsting for knowledge until
the last, keep their noses in their books. Their
comrades sometimes tease them, calling them
“tenth-boners” in good-natured derision, or steal
up behind them and shut their books for them
saying, “Oh, come off spec-ing tenths,” which
means to desist from studying at the last moments
to better the mark.</p>

<p>At one minute before assembly the cadet officer
of the day, a straight young man in a red sash and
red crossbelt (bound up, as Patsy O’Hara of
1904 wittily remarked, in his official red tape),
takes his post in the center of the area and commands:
“Form your sections!”</p>

<p>Instantly books are slammed, all noises, talking,
laughing, skylarking, cease, and the scattered gray
figures seem to magically form themselves into
compact little squads under the direction of their
section marchers who stand out in front counting
them. The door of the Guardhouse opens and the
O. C. (officer in charge) appears upon the “poop
deck,” stern, implacable, almost sphinx-like, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
surveys coldly the formation. For the brief
space of a few seconds all is quiet except for the
occasional shuffling of a section that has misjudged
its proper space. Then the trumpeter
sounds the assembly. A few belated men are
tearing to their places in ranks, running a race
with the fading notes of the trumpet and landing
bang! into the rear rank just in time to
keep from being reported absent. The kind-hearted
trumpeter often takes a deeper breath
(especially in winter when he sees the belated
ones recklessly dashing across the icy walks),
and holds on to those last notes of assembly in a
way that was never intended by the composer.
God bless him!</p>

<p>Meanwhile the instructors are in the section
rooms awaiting the arrival of their classes. Here
and there in the windows of the rooms facing
the area is an instructor gazing upon this class
formation that is the same today as it was years
ago, and that awakens in him a flood of memories
of his own cadet days when he too set out to recite
to an instructor who never seemed quite human.
As he looks at the cadets forming, he realizes
how distinctly the institution creates its types,
and he is able to pick out certain individuals and
say to himself:</p>

<p>“There goes so and so of my class!”</p>

<p>The great charm of West Point is that so many
things never change. Some of the cadets, sons of
graduates, are doing exactly as their fathers did at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
their age, and again a few cadets are reacting the
youth of their grandfathers.</p>

<p>While the instructor is watching the cadets in
the area, the section marcher reports to the
officer of the day all absentees in his section which
he then marches off to the Academic Building.
On the sections come in military formation straight
to the classroom door. The halls of the building
resound to the tramping of many feet as the cadets
march along with muffled tread, thanks to O’Sullivan
rubber heels that are fitted to every pair of
shoes. When opposite the classroom door the
section marcher commands:</p>

<p>“Section halt! Fall out!”</p>

<p>The cadets hang up their caps in the hall, file
into the room, and stand rigidly at attention behind
their desks. The section marcher enters, closes
the door, takes his position in the center of the
room facing the instructor, salutes, and reports:</p>

<p>“Sir, all are present,” or “Cadet Ducrot is
absent.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ducrot now makes his acquaintance with
Mathematics, the study that determines more
than any other his standing at West Point. From
the day that he commences his studies he feels
that he must devote the greater amount of time to
this subject, and with reason. A perusal of the
tables of instruction shows that the greater proportion
of time and weight is allotted to the
mathematical studies. The total amount of time
provided for in the course of instruction, including
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
riding and gymnasium, is 192,900 minutes. If
gymnasium and riding are deducted (11,205 and
10,860 minutes, respectively) there are left 170,835
minutes devoted to Academic work. Of this
amount the pure mathematical subjects are allotted
76,555 minutes, and the non-mathematical
subjects, 94,280 minutes.</p>

<p>These figures represent the time that is actually
spent in the recitation work. To give an accurate
idea of the draught of these subjects upon the
cadet’s time, however, we should estimate the
amount of time required for preparation plus
the time spent in the section room. The lessons
are so assigned that these preparations take the
average cadet twice the time allotted to the
recitation. Thus, in subjects having an hour
and twenty-five minute recitations, the average
cadet is expected to spend two hours and fifty
minutes in preparation; and in subjects having one
hour periods, two hours of preparation. Practical
Surveying and Drawing are subjects for which no
preparation is required.</p>

<p>Adding the preparation time to the recitation
time we find the total relative amounts of time as
follows:</p>

<table class="tdc">
  <tr>
    <th><i>Mathematical Subjects.</i></th>
    <th><i>Non-Mathematical Subjects.</i></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdc"> 76,555</td>
    <td class="tdc"> 94,280</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdc">136,940</td>
    <td class="tdc">145,440</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdc bt">213,495</td>
    <td class="tdc bt">239,720</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span></p>

<p>The time devoted to mathematical subjects is
divided among only five departments, whereas the
time divided among non-mathematical subjects
is divided among nine departments. Again, each
subject is weighted and the five mathematical
subjects have almost as many units as the nine
non-mathematical subjects. Out of the 2325
units required for graduation (leaving out of
account the 200 allotted to conduct) the five
mathematical departments have 1065 and the
nine other departments have 1260. It is no
wonder that Mr. Ducrot wishes to make an auspicious
beginning in a study that is so important to
his future career. The conduct of the recitation
that he attends for the first time is about the
same in every department. In Mathematics,
which is an exact science, the system is perhaps a
little more rigid than in some of the non-mathematical
departments.</p>

<p>As soon as the cadets have taken their seats
the instructor asks:</p>

<p>“Are there any questions on the lesson?”</p>

<p>The cadets are then at liberty to ask for an explanation
of any part of the lesson that they have
not been able to comprehend. The officer uses
his judgment as to the amount of time to be thus
consumed. Sometimes he will take up half
the recitation period to clear up the obscurities
of the lesson, but if he has one of the lower sections
he sometimes has to be on his guard, for the cadets
on the days of hard lessons astutely ask many
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
questions in order to consume the recitation period.
I know one officer who always outwitted these
youthful diplomats when they attempted to stave
off the recitation. He would begin speaking so
rapidly that no one could interrupt:</p>

<p>“Any questions-pages-one-two-three-four-too-late-close-your-books.
Mr. Ducrot-take-the-first-front-board.”</p>

<p>Each cadet is sent to the blackboard with an
enunciation, that is, some phase of the lesson to
discuss, or perhaps the instructor may question a
few men. The cadet writes his name on the board
in the upper right-hand corner and proceeds to
place upon the slate enough data to assist him
in his recitation. In Mathematics, he solves his
problem; in other subjects the topic that he will
develop orally.</p>

<p>As soon as the cadet is ready to recite he takes a
pointer in his hand and faces the instructor and
stands at attention until called upon. In order
to test thoroughly the cadet’s reasoning powers
the instructor will sometimes lead him on along a
false path, practically making the recitation himself,
saying:</p>

<p>“Is not that so?” and again, “Is that not so?”</p>

<p>To which the lad, if not thoroughly sure of himself,
will be betrayed into replying:</p>

<p>“Yes, sir!” “Yes, sir!”</p>

<p>Finally when the deduction has been rendered
ridiculous, the officer will sharply say:</p>

<p>“That is perfectly absurd.” The cadet receives
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
a lesson that he does not forget. Once or twice
as a cadet I was in this position and I know the
feeling.</p>

<p>After each cadet is heard, he is given other
problems with which to wrestle while the other
cadets are reciting. When a principle of particular
importance is to be demonstrated, all of the cadets
are required to face about and give their close
attention in order that they may all benefit from
the instruction.</p>

<p>During a recitation a visit may be expected
at any time from the Professor or Head of the
Department. Upon his entrance, the cadets all
rise and stand at attention until they are told to
proceed with their work.</p>

<p>The Professor either listens to the cadets
recite or conducts the recitation himself. The
recitation continues until the bugler blows the
“Recall” in the area. What a welcome sound is
this to those few who have spent the hour at the
board, without reciting, vainly staring at the blank
slate in the hope of drawing some inspiration from
its cold surface! They have been “bugling,”
waiting for the bugle to sound “Recall.” They
quickly drop chalk, eraser, pointer, and joyfully
file out of the room exchanging with their
co-conspirators sympathetic smiles, and surreptitiously
“rubbing their bellies,” as a sign of
excessive joy.</p>

<p>The instructor at West Point has one great advantage
over his fellow instructors in the colleges.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
His time is not occupied with trifling on the part
of the students. The cadets are so thoroughly
disciplined by the Tactical Department that
their deportment in class is irreproachable. It
is very rare that the recitation is interrupted to
make corrections other than academic. The
cadets are held to a high standard of discipline
all the time. In class they are not permitted to
communicate with one another, but they talk freely
with the instructor about points in the lesson.</p>

<p>So much for the actual recitation, the conduct
of which seems so smooth and simple. In the
background, however, there is an admirable
organization that strives for a maximum of
efficiency in the instruction.</p>

<p>Every department consists of the Professor or
Head of the Department, an assistant professor,
and the requisite number of instructors which
varies with the size of the classes. In the Departments
of Mathematics and Modern Languages,
each of which instructs two classes, the Professor
is aided by an associate professor, besides the
assistants.</p>

<p>The Professor is in complete control of his
entire department. He prepares the courses of
instruction, recommends the adoption of new
text-books, or abolition of those in use, apportions
the work among his instructors, conducts
and supervises the conferences of his instructors,
prepares and supervises the examination
of the classes pursuing his course, is responsible
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
for all property belonging to his department,
and is the channel through which must pass all
reports and official communications relating to
departmental affairs.</p>

<p>In nearly all of the departments the Professor
is able to standardize the instruction of the cadets
by means of conferences with his instructors.
These meetings are informal, partaking more of
the nature of a <i>conversazione</i> in which the Professor
outlines his wishes to his officers, emphasizing the
points of the lesson that he wishes brought out.
The conferences also offer to the instructors the
opportunity to make suggestions to the Head of
the Department in regard to the section-room
work, pointing out the success or failure of certain
features of the previous lesson.</p>

<p>The conferences are comparatively recent in the
scheme of instruction at the Academy, but they
are of great value to the officers. The result is
that the instructor enters the section room with
a feeling of confidence and a knowledge that his
methods are approved in advance by his immediate
chief. Moreover, the Professor is able to go
from one section room to another and find that the
teaching of the lesson is progressing uniformly.
I have always considered the conference feature
the greatest aid in my work as an instructor, for
besides the profit derived from the Professor’s talk,
there is always a constant interchange of ideas, of
impressions, or perhaps a heated argument between
the officers, all of which stimulate the mind and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
the imagination, and sharpen the wits. Furthermore,
these meetings tend to produce harmony
by drawing the officers together in a common cause.
The introduction of conferences has markedly
changed the former attitude of the instructor
toward his work, so that instead of merely hearing
the lesson and marking the cadet, as prevailed too
frequently in years gone by, the officer is inspired
to impart a maximum of knowledge and help to his
student. I feel sure that the average of the teaching
is rising year by year, due in large measure
to the intelligent conduct of conferences by the
various professors with their officer assistants.</p>

<p>In addition to their work in the preparation
and teaching of the daily lessons, instructors are
required to keep the record of the cadets’ marks.
For this purpose, pasteboard cards properly ruled
for the days of the week, averages, and proportional
parts are provided, one for each cadet.
After the conclusion of the day’s recitation the
mark is entered by the instructor on the cadet’s
card, and at the end of the week, all of the marks
are transferred to a weekly report that each
instructor submits for the cadets under his charge.
These reports, or “tenth sheets” as the cadets
call them, are publicly posted in glass frames
in the sally-port, where they remain for one week,
during which time the cadets are at liberty to
inspect them. In this manner, a cadet can always
tell exactly what progress he is making, whether
deficient or proficient. There is never any attempt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
at secrecy, but, on the contrary, every
facility is afforded the cadet to ascertain his
standing. The pasteboard cards form the permanent
record and are carefully filed in the department.</p>

<p>The weekly reports are usually posted every
Saturday while the battalions are at inspection.
Immediately upon breaking ranks, what a scramble
ensues to get a peep at the result of the week’s
work! Struggling cadets elbow and crowd one
another to get close to the frames, each heart
beating in anticipation of the figures that mean
for some success and for others failure. The
difference of perhaps one tenth in the total will
sometimes fill the lad with dejection for the rest
of the afternoon.</p>

<p>No one is deprived of the privilege of consulting
his marks. Even those cadets serving punishment,
such as confinement to rooms, can obtain
permission to inspect the reports. More often,
however, they send some plebe to copy the marks
for them. The publicity of the marking has an
excellent effect upon the cadet, for he knows what
each man in his section accomplished during the
week and sees that no partiality is shown nor
injustice done by the instructor.</p>

<p>The scale of marking that is used at West Point
was introduced when Major Sylvanus Thayer
was Superintendent in 1837. Upon this scale a
perfect recitation receives a mark of 3.0; good
is represented by 2.5; indifferent by 2.0; bad, 1.5;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
imperfect, 1.0; and complete failure 0.0. The
instructor may mark as close as a tenth giving a
2.8 or a 2.1 or a 1.4 as the recitation merits.</p>

<p>Since the marks determine a cadet’s graduation
standing and affect his whole career as an officer,
they naturally are given by him no little consideration.
Sometimes I think that the cadets give
entirely too much thought to attaining a good
grade rather than to the thorough mastering
of the subject; that is, they have a tendency to
develop the memory at the expense of the thinking
functions. As I have explained before West
Point methods are strictly opposed to such a
system, and the departments discourage verbatim
recitations. The marking offers many difficulties
at an institution such as West Point because a
difference of a few hundredths between two cadets’
standing will alter their choice of a branch or Corps
and affect their relative promotion by years. At
colleges and universities this condition does not
exist, for a man’s standing has little connection
with his future career.</p>

<p>The cadet is not allowed to select his own course,
or follow his own inclinations in regard to the
curriculum. The mental diet is prescribed and
no deviation therefrom is permitted. The three
broad fundamentals governing the Academic
course are: first, that every cadet shall take every
subject; second, that before advancement every
cadet shall be proficient in every subject; and
third, that every cadet must recite every day.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span></p>

<p>As regards the above principles there is, of course
a little qualification in each, sufficient to admit of
some flexibility in application. While no cadet
is permitted to elect whether or no he will take a
subject, but is required to take all of them, still,
some of the more advanced cadets go further in
the subjects. In nearly every department the
higher men have advanced or special courses.</p>

<p>As for the second principle, a cadet who is
deficient in any one subject is usually dismissed.
Occasionally, however, where a man stands
especially well in all of his studies but fails in one,
he may be conditioned by the Academic Board, or
in some cases turned back to join the next class.
Among the cadets, he becomes known as a “turnback,”
a name that usually sticks to him, but
conveys no reproach or stigma.</p>

<p>Again, the cadet must recite every day. Owing
to the small section of ten or twelve cadets the
instructor is ordinarily able to hear every man, so
that the studies must be prepared. There is no
such thing at West Point as a “cut.” Sometimes,
due to the lack of time, the instructor may not
hear a few of the cadets, but this is rare. In such
a case the cadet does not get a mark but is given
what is colloquially known as “stay-back,” that is,
a blank. The certainty that he must recite every
day and that no failure can be hidden obliges each
cadet to prepare his lesson with great thoroughness.
The effect of this system on moral character
is immediate. It inculcates attention to duty,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
habits of study and thought, and pride in achievement.</p>

<p>At West Point good intellectual performance is a
duty just as much as guard, parade, or inspection,
so that an unsatisfactory recitation due to the
cadet’s negligence not only begets a bad mark, but
not infrequently a punishment. Moreover, since
the cadets realize that their final standing at
graduation permits them to choose their branch
of the service, they are keen to do their very best
to beat the other fellows. This spirit of competition
is fostered by transfers of cadets from one
section to another either up or down, according to
their weekly marks.</p>

<p>Cadets receive individual instruction in every
subject. No man can therefore hide his lack of
preparation because he is always called upon
to develop some phase of the lesson. At the
beginning of the term, the Fourth Classmen
or plebes are arranged alphabetically into sections
in which they remain for about six weeks. Then
there is a general transfer or rearrangement of
sections according to the marks made during this
period. The top man in each section is the section
marcher. Thereafter cadets rise and fall in the
sections, either weekly or monthly as the Professor
wishes. The transfers from one section
to another are a great stimulant to the cadet.
He gets the reward for his labor. Sometimes,
however, in spite of determined efforts, some cadets
lose sections, due perhaps to a lack of preparation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
prior to entrance; others go down through laziness
or negligence.</p>

<p>The cadets that land in the last section are
known as “The Goats” (in olden days, “The Immortals”),
usually a carefree lot who never worry
until the examinations roll around. They are a
great contrast to the first section men who
“bone tenths” with Prussian thrift. But whether
“Goats” or first section men each one receives
individual instruction.</p>

<p>Nor are the cadets who are low in their studies
deprived of extra instruction. When Major-General
Thomas H. Barry was Superintendent, he introduced
a system permitting cadets to receive,
during their recreation hours, extra instruction
upon any back lesson. The cadets can therefore
overcome the obstacles that prevent them from
going forward in any particular study. Due to
this system, many a cadet has been saved who
otherwise would have been “found,” simply because
he was slow and had not had time to digest
his lesson.</p>

<p>It is in the lower sections chiefly that humorous
incidents occur to lighten the tension of the
atmosphere. As an instructor in French, I had
many a chuckle over the struggles of some of the
Goats to master the tongue of <i>la douce France</i>.
On one occasion a cadet was attempting to translate
a passage in the reader. His efforts were futile.
Few of the words meant anything to him. All at
once he came to the proper name “Léopold, Duc
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
d’Autriche.” With a triumphant gleam at me
who had been humiliating him with embarrassing
questions, he proudly translated the phrase: “The
leopard, the duck, and the ostrich.”</p>

<p>On another occasion there was in the section a
foreign cadet from Venezuela whose acquaintance
with English was chiefly limited to swear words.
While translating a passage in French in the
presence of the Professor, he came across the sentence:
<i>Mon Dieu, j’ai laissé tomber le vase.</i> Immediately
he began:</p>

<p>“My God&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh no, Mr. Honduras,” gently interposed the
Professor.</p>

<p>“Oh Hell,” he began once more.</p>

<p>“Dear no, Mr. Honduras, not so strong!”
exclaimed the thoroughly shocked Professor. But
Honduras understanding (maliciously I thought)
that a stronger translation was wanted, ventured
once more:</p>

<p>“&mdash;&mdash;! &mdash;&mdash;! &mdash;&mdash;!”</p>

<p>Had Honduras been a little American boy, I
am sure that the Professor would have made him
wash out his mouth with soap.</p>

<p>The success of the West Point system is largely
due to several unique reasons. In the first place
the authorities control the time of the cadets so
completely that it can be utilized to the greatest
advantage. Again, West Point’s remoteness from
any large city and the strict regulations that
govern the privileges of the cadet remove the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
many temptations that consume the college man’s
time. To the same extent, the mind of the cadet
is not diverted. Every effort is made to get the
maximum mental results from the cadet’s labor.
He has regular hours of study, plenty of exercise,
a judicious amount of recreation, and good wholesome
food. In addition, the cadet is in a studious
atmosphere. No opportunity is lost to impress
upon him correct habits of study.</p>

<p>I dare say that at no other institution of learning
is there such serious preparation of the lessons.
The cadet’s academic day contains but half an
hour of leisure from 6:00 <small>A.M.</small> to 10:00 <small>A.M.</small>
except during the extreme cold weather when
drills are suspended the cadets have two hours
in the afternoon. All during the day therefore
when not at recitations, riding, or gymnasium, the
cadets are studying, and the long study period is
from 7:00 to 9:30 <small>P.M.</small> Although prohibited by
Regulations, many men study after taps, especially
those low in the class. To conceal the light they
hang a leg of their trousers over the electric light,
lowering the cord until it almost touches the table.
Just a little circle of light shines upon the book,
and not enough to be detected from without.</p>

<p>West Point is not indifferent to the performance
of its students. It cannot afford to be less exacting,
but it has a powerful leverage over other
institutions for it dangles before the cadet’s view
the prize of a commission in the Regular Army,
a career in an honorable profession.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span></p>

<p>The course of instruction at the Military Academy
develops in the cadet certain traits of character
that are invaluable to him in a profession
where, as an officer, he is constantly being called
upon to meet all sorts of contingencies, to exercise
his judgment, and to make decisions. His studies
and duties broaden his mind, make him self-reliant,
and teach him self-control. It is astounding
to see the results obtained by the system. As
a proof of the intellectual product of the Academy,
I shall quote the following table, giving the
occupations of the graduates who have gone into
civil life where they have measured their strength
with the graduates of other institutions of learning:</p>

<p>The above list should be convincing that if
methods of training which are primarily intended
to develop officers can produce such signal and
distinguished successes in every walk of civil life,
no fault can be found with their soundness.</p>

<p>The Academic year is divided into two terms
that end in the fall and the spring. A month
prior to the conclusion of each term, each Department
conducts a general review of the subjects
studied that semester. Cadets who make a
proficient average upon this review, which is
generally written, are exempt from the examinations.
These reviews are very thorough and
searching. The questions are framed to test the
cadet’s real knowledge of the subject. In order to
avoid all personal element entering into the marks,
the papers are graded by all of the instructors,
each marking one question. In this manner the
marks are uniform and fair as possible, and no one
instructor has any great influence in assigning
to a man his class standing.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span></p>

<p>Following the reviews come the examinations for
those who failed upon the review. These tests
are also quite rigid, and in order to be declared
proficient a man must make two thirds of the
mark, .66 per cent. The examination papers are
likewise marked by all of the instructors and by
the Professor. In the event that a cadet fails he is
reported to the Academic Board for their action.
In general, if deficient in any one subject, the cadet
is dismissed.</p>

<p>I feel how weak are any words that I might use
to attempt to describe the despair into which a
discharged cadet is plunged. For days he lives in
an excruciating suspense awaiting the result of the
examinations. The thought of wasted opportunity,
the regret for lack of early preparation
perhaps, and worse than all, the sense of failure
torment him. It is bitter to renounce the camaraderie
and friendship of his fellows and to see
himself involuntarily separated from surroundings
that he has come to love. At last the dread
news comes. The Adjutant rises from his seat in
the Mess Hall and calls the Battalion to attention.
Immediately a deathlike stillness pervades the
cadet body. The gravity and dignity of the Adjutant’s
demeanor unconsciously inform the Corps
that distressing news is about to be communicated.
Slowly and distinctly the names are read
out, one by one, and as they fall upon the
straining ears of the cadets, they sound like so
many death sentences for the unfortunate lads who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
are “found.” A gloom of sorrow settles over the
Corps and the companies file out of the hall in
sympathetic silence. But the reality must be
faced. Suitcases and trunks are packed, accounts
are quickly settled, affectionate and emotional
good-byes are said, and sadly the discharged cadets
drop out of the ranks of the Corps. The long
gray line closes up and once again marches forward
to do battle with the Academic obstacles that
block the road to graduation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span></p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />

<span class="large">GROWING MUSCLES</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Whenever</span> the cadets leave the seclusion
of West Point and appear in public in
uniform, their erect carriage, their smart tight-fitting
dress coats that show off their broad
muscular shoulders and slender waists never fail
to excite favorable comment and praise. It
most generally finds expression from a group of
giggling maidens who evince a great curiosity
about the cadets’ slender waists, either openly remarking
that they are artificial or more specifically
assuring themselves, when advantage can be
taken of a cadet, by poking the gray bound torso
around the middle line, timidly asking him if
he wears corsets, a remark that usually serves
as an introduction to a harmless flirtation.</p>

<p>The splendid set-up of the cadets is not, however,
due to stays, whalebones in the dress coats,
Dr. Quack’s abdominal bandages, or to any other
mechanical appliances. It is the result of a very
highly intelligent system of physical training, to
which the supple young body of the cadet is submitted
for four years. Naturally, little by little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
his muscles, through exercise, attain their proper
development, and since no one set of muscles is
neglected, the body gradually assumes a well-rounded,
finished appearance. The material for
instruction is good and healthy, because all of the
cadets have been submitted to a rigid physical
examination before entrance. They are not, however,
all perfect specimens, for many possess
minor defects and blemishes, unimportant as far
as affecting their military value to the Government,
but which can be eradicated by proper physical
training.</p>

<p>The instructor of physical training is greatly
aided in his actual work, by the kind of life the
cadet leads, so that he has not to struggle with a
crowd of men who after having received physical
training daily, indulge themselves to their heart’s
content. He has, on the contrary, a set of young
men who live under the strictest and simplest conditions
in a healthy environment, and whose diet
is most wholesome. No late suppers, no beer, no
rich food are at work to keep up the rotundity
of the stomach, the <i>coram nobis</i> of the Romans,
or to produce a lot of flabby fat, but good cereals,
nourishing meats and vegetables, even the despised
“slum,” are indirect factors in keeping
healthy the cadet’s body.</p>

<p>West Point believes that for a man to do the
best mental work, his body must be in the best
condition. The Academy was the first educational
institution in the country to recognize that hand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
in hand with the student’s mental training must
go the proper development of his physical powers.
As long ago as 1817, Captain Partridge, the
Superintendent of the Military Academy, incorporated
in the curriculum bodily exercises. Since
that time the importance of physical training in
the cadet’s course has been given recognition, but
frankly there was no real system of physical training
until 1846. A gymnasium was then prepared
and instruction given by First Lieut. H. C.
Wayne, First Artillery. This was a beginning,
but the authorities were hampered by lack of
equipment, and also by no very great knowledge
of how to proceed. The science of physical
training was in its infancy, it must be remembered,
but crude as was the instruction it was the genesis
of the splendid course that now exists.</p>

<p>For a long period after the Civil War, 1865-1882,
cadets attended the gymnasium as they saw
fit, a system that was no system. The original
course from which the present course has developed
was inaugurated in February, 1885.</p>

<p>The daily routine at the Academy is extremely
exacting and hard, and I doubt very much if a
large number of men could stand the strain and
daily grind of the Academic year, if they were
not physically prepared to meet its requirements.
Since all Academic duties are suspended during
part of June, July, and August, in order to devote
these months to practical military instruction,
the new cadets are directed to report in June.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
Two months are then at the disposal of the authorities
to strengthen the new arrivals’ bodies, both
by prescribed physical exercises and by the
exercise incident to the drills and maneuvers,
before the studies begin in September.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_196" src="images/i_196.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">The Exterior of the Gymnasium</p></div>

<p>During the first three weeks of the new cadet’s
training, setting-up exercises begin his day’s
work. After his breakfast has had time to digest,
he and his fellows are marched over to the main
room of the gymnasium for forty-five minutes’
physical drill. Although the setting-up exercises
may be given outdoors, and have always been
heretofore, the gymnasium is now used to eliminate
the distraction of the cadet’s attention by passersby
whose amusement at the efforts of the stiff
and awkward “beasts” reacted upon the new
cadets.</p>

<p>The recruit instruction begins with the most
simple exercises. The cadet is taught first the
position of attention; that his heels must be together,
his feet turned out just so much, his knees
devoid of stiffness, in a word, what he shall do
with his hips, arms, and hands, keeping his head
erect, his chin drawn in, and his eyes straight to
the front. Simple as is the position of attention,
many men take a long time to learn it. Some
never can comply with all the requirements,
for how can the bow-legged man and the knock-kneed
chap keep their legs “straight without
stiffness”?</p>

<p>Then follow breathing exercises to increase the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
wind capacity, to permit longer and more extended
drills, and to lead up to the simple movements
designed to develop the muscles upon which the
position of attention is dependent.</p>

<p>The cadets line up on the gymnasium floor.
The instructor commands: “Count off!”</p>

<p>“One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four!” “One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four!”
in weak voices and strong voices, diminuendo
and crescendo, is repeated all down the line,
each man snapping his head to the front as he calls
his number. The inequality of tone of voice is
gradually eliminated so that after a few drills the
count off is uniform in pitch.</p>

<p>“Take distance. March!” commands the drill
master followed by “Company, halt!” when the
men have become sufficiently separated to perform
the exercises without interfering with one another.</p>

<p>Various exercises are then taught, the simple
ones first, followed by the more complex movements
to develop a coördination of all muscles
and a feeling of control over one’s body. The
set of exercises used at the Academy are simple
in the extreme and executed by even simpler
commands. It is astonishing how in a few minutes
a perfectly green squad can be taught to
execute movements not only in unison, but even
with precision and smartness. The great value of
the commands lies in the fact that no elaborate
explanations are necessary. All the recruit has
to do is to watch the instructor. Let me illustrate
by an example. The instructor commands:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span></p>

<p>“1. Arms forward. 2. Raise.”</p>

<p>The cadet raises his arm in front of him to height
of shoulders, holding them in this position while
the instructor says:</p>

<p>“Swing arms down at 1 and up at 2. Ready!
exercise! One! Two! ... One! Halt!”</p>

<p>All movements cease with arms in raised
position.</p>

<p>“Arms down.” All drop their arms smartly.</p>

<p>Of course, to the simple movements are added
various combinations, and all exercises are executed
both at a halt and while marching. The walking
with measured step gives poise and grace of carriage.
The recruits are also practiced in the run
and double time, the latter a military step to gain
ground rapidly, but with a minimum inroad upon
the wind and endurance of the soldier. Setting-up
exercises are the most valuable preliminary
training for any body of men entering the military
service. For the first week the body is sore and
aches to the point of great fatigue, but after the
preliminary soreness disappears, a feeling of
control supplants it, and the general health of the
body is better. No brown pills are necessary;
no headaches from biliousness exist. A good
forty-five minute setting-up drill every morning,
plenty of wholesome food, and eight hours’ sleep
contribute to the cadet’s good health. The Mess
Hall, not to be outdone by other departments,
lends its aid by serving judicious plates of prunes.
These preliminary setting-up drills, given during
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
the first few weeks, are discontinued for a short
period in camp when the cadets are busy learning
other drills.</p>

<p>Swimming now replaces the setting-up exercises
until the battalions return to barracks in September.
The new cadets must be able to swim at
least ten minutes without changing their stroke,
which standard each cadet must measure before he
is excused from attendance at the swimming drills.
These drills are never a bore, however, but anticipated
with great pleasure by nearly all of the men.
Nothing is so refreshing on a hot summer’s day,
after a tedious drill upon the dusty Plain, than the
march over to the “Gym” for a swim in the
deliciously cool clean water of the tank. Instruction
is also given in resuscitating men who are
apparently drowned.</p>

<p>When September comes and the studies are
commenced, the Fourth Class resumes its setting-up
exercises, to which are added gymnastic work.</p>

<p>In the fall each cadet is given a thorough examination
at which all of his measurements are accurately
taken, and various strength tests are made.
This information is entered on a card and filed
for future reference, because later on the cadets
are again measured and tested in order that the
improvement may be noted.</p>

<p>Measurements are made of the height, chest,
waist, arms, legs; and strength tests are made of
the arms, hands, back, and legs. These methods
quickly reveal wherein the cadet is deficient, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
allow the instructor, like a doctor, to prescribe for
each individual the necessary exercises. For example,
those whose chests are under-developed are
assigned to the chest weights until the deficiency
is made up, and where the smaller muscles of the
arms and shoulders need attention practice is
given with the Indian clubs and medicine balls.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_200" src="images/i_200.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Gymnastic Exercises</p></div>

<p>To develop in all of them power, vigor, and endurance,
the groups of large muscles of the back,
chest, abdomen, and legs are improved by setting-up
exercises, dumb-bells, and wands, jumping,
climbing, and lastly by apparatus work. This
class of exercises is reserved until the muscles
have been more or less controlled and respond to
the will, for the execution depends not so much
upon muscular effort as it does upon agility. It
would never do to start in green men on the
apparatus work, because there would soon result
broken legs and arms. This work is hard enough
for those lacking “muscle sense,” even after many
months of preliminary exercises.</p>

<p>Included in the schedule for the first year’s
work is instruction in the saber and the foils, but
as the amount of time that can be devoted to these
branches of instruction is limited, only the most
elementary features of the arts can be taught.
An opportunity, however, is afforded cadets to
perfect themselves in the use of both the saber
and the foil after regular hours. During the
winter months, when the vigorous weather requires
a suspension of outdoor drilling, the fencing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
master gives individual lessons to those who
desire to take them. The volunteers are formed
into a squad known as the Fencing Squad, from
which are organized, for each weapon, class
teams. The interests at West Point are so many
and varied that it is impossible for each cadet to
be an accomplished fencer, boxer, wrestler, gymnast,
or swimmer, but each one is given instruction
in the fundamentals. The cadets usually select the
art that appeals to them most and perfect themselves
along the chosen line. The saber is popular,
and many cadets acquire great dexterity in its
manipulation. It is distinctly a soldierly exercise,
so that it exercises a fascination for the men, especially
for those who intend to choose the cavalry.</p>

<p>Instruction in the use of the foils is given to the
entire class assembled by sections, and consists of
preliminary instruction in the single rank without
weapon, in the single rank with foils, and in the
double rank with foils. As with the saber, the
men whose sport by predilection is fencing with
foils take individual lessons from the fencing master
every afternoon from November until March.
The interest in fencing at one time was exceedingly
great, and the sport was regarded as one of the
major activities of cadet life. This interest was
due to the participation of cadet teams in the
Intercollegiate Fencing Meet, but five years ago
the Academy authorities prohibited cadet teams
from attending these competitions. This action
killed the interest in fencing for several years, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
at present the former popularity of this excellent
sport is returning, and a visitor may now see
the thirteen double mats, accommodating fifty-two
men, constantly filled.</p>

<p>When President Roosevelt, in 1905, ordered
that all cadets should attend gymnasium daily,
assistants were detailed to assist the officer in
charge of physical training. For the fencing, the
Academy secured the services of a <i>maître d’armes</i>
under whose careful and scientific training, the
fencing teams of the Academy continued their
brilliant achievements begun in 1902. Beginning
with that year until 1910, West Point sent
to the annual intercollegiate championship meets,
teams that contested with Harvard, Yale, Cornell,
Pennsylvania, Columbia, and the Navy. Out
of the nine meets, West Point won six, and obtained
second place in the other three, yielding
their supremacy to their great rivals, the Navy.
This remarkable record was accomplished by
the untiring efforts of the team and of their much-liked
instructor, M. Vauthier, whose skill excited
their admiration and inspired in them a splendid
spirit of emulation.</p>

<p>More attention is now paid to the bayonet
fencing due to the extended use of that weapon
in the present European War, but as with the other
arts, the limited time permits the teaching of
only the fundamentals. The cadet learns enough
in each branch to build upon afterwards and
make himself a competent instructor.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span></p>

<p>Not less popular than the fencing are the boxing
and wrestling exercises. The first year men are
assembled in classes and given instruction in
boxing in the guard, footwork, parries, simple
direct leads and counters. Similarly in wrestling,
the simple holds, resultant falls, and the breaks
for the simple holds are all taught.</p>

<p>It is not, however, to the regular class work
that one must go to judge of the grip that these
manly sports have upon the cadets. In the
afternoon, after recitations, embryo Jeffries and
Fitzsimmonses gather in the boxing room to
receive the holy instruction from the master, Mr.
Jenkins, or “Tom,” as he is affectionately called
among themselves. There he teaches the aspirant
pugilist how to land a blow and how to avoid one,
and occasionally to make the lesson more realistic
he treats his young charge to the experience of
receiving one. Some experiences in a man’s life
grow dim, but never this one.</p>

<p>When the preliminary bouts are being fought,
large numbers flock to the boxing room to cheer
for the weaker fellow even though he be of another
class than one’s own. Boxing develops fine
qualities among the men. It teaches them to
give and take, to receive punishment without
flinching, and to respect the skill of a good opponent.
Besides it gives a man confidence in his
powers, making him think quickly and move
quickly, all excellent qualities for an officer of
the army.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span></p>

<p>Boxing, however, shares the popular appeal with
wrestling. This manly sport that we have inherited
from our ancestors of the stone age fascinates
men chiefly by virtue of its brute strength
and to a lesser degree by its skill. It is a game
for men of all sizes, provided they possess the
necessary qualities of courage and strength.</p>

<p>The boxing room on winter afternoons presents
a warm and pleasing contrast to the cold and
snow outside. The mats are covered with agile
forms in black jersey tights wriggling and squirming,
the perspiration rolling off the wrestlers as
they endeavor to grind the shoulders of their
opponents to the mat. All men receive instruction
in wrestling in class, but like the other sports, its
devotees must repair for extra instruction to Mr.
Jenkins during recreation hours. It is in this
time that men practice for their class teams, one
for each of the following weights: unlimited, heavy,
light heavy, middle, welter, light, and feather.
The four class teams meet each other successively
to wrestle for the class championship. There is
besides a contest for the individual championship,
the final bouts which take place publicly at the
Annual Indoor Meet.</p>

<p>Prior to the resumption of the afternoon military
drills in March, the cadets hold their annual
gymnastic event called the Indoor Meet. The
contests, which are held with great ceremony in
the Gymnasium, include races, pole climbing,
work on horizontal bars and parallel bars, long
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
and short horse, rings both stationary and flying,
and the tug of war between the classes.</p>

<p>Each class enters so many men for each event,
and for the awards of first, second, or third, the
contestant receives a designated number of
points. The class receiving the greatest total
wins the meet. This athletic event is a very
fitting way to end the winter course, for it offers
an opportunity to those men who have labored
faithfully during the winter afternoons to reap the
reward of their efforts. It also is an incentive
for better work because of the spirit of competition.
The Athletic Association upon this occasion,
presents sabers, both to the captain of the football
team and to that member of the First Class
who during his cadet career has done the most for
athletics. It is a very proud night for these
young men as they walk forward to receive the
coveted saber, the first part of their officer’s equipment.</p>

<p>There is great rivalry among the classes during
the events. The four corners of the room are
filled with the members of each class, who yell
like demons to encourage their representatives.
Almost every minute the air is filled with shrieks
and yells of excited cadets whose “Zis-boom-ahs!”
“Rah! Rah! Rahs!” “1917! 1918!!...”
are hurled at one another to the delight and amusement
of the spectators, young and old, hanging
over the iron railing of the gallery.</p>

<p>The courses in gymnastics, wrestling, and boxing,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
increase in difficulty according to the class, so that
the Third and Second Classmen pursue a more
advanced course than the plebes. When, however,
the cadets become First Classmen, emphasis is
laid upon the theories of physical training with the
object of preparing these “near officers” for their
duties as instructors in the service. The needs
of the Army are carefully considered in the training
of the last year in order to send out from West
Point men who can at once take hold of a group
of recruits and whip them into good physical
shape, according to the most intelligent methods.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the setting-up exercises in the
Army are only spasmodically taught. There is
very little uniformity in the method, despite the
excellent manual with which the troops are
provided.</p>

<p>West Point is at present making an effort to
influence the Service to a better appreciation of the
results to be derived from regular drill in setting-up
exercises. To this end, the First Classmen are
taught to act as instructors, and are grounded
not only in actual practice but in theory. Every
year extra classes are held to develop good instructors
for the coming summer camps, and for
future service in the Army. It is to be hoped that
commanding officers will make good use of these
enthusiastic young teachers.</p>

<p>Although the control of athletics at the Academy
is not under the gymnasium authorities, still it
is fitting to speak of the sports in this chapter.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
The Academy has its football, baseball, basketball,
and hockey teams, and in addition the cadets
play golf, polo, and tennis. There is little in the
training or conduct of these teams that differs
from other educational institutions, except the
question of time allowed for preparation. It has
always been the rule at West Point that no inroads
shall be permitted upon the Academic course
to aid the development of any athletic team.
Consequently, what practice the teams get must
be during recreation hours. The only concessions
made are supper a half-hour later for the football
men, and exemptions twice a week from parade
for the baseball men. Athletics receive, however,
the greatest support and encouragement from the
authorities, whose aim is, however, not to develop
a few good men or an excellent team in any one
sport, but to seek a good average.</p>

<p>Every cadet is urged to join in some form of
athletics instead of remaining in his dress coat
along the side lines as an interested spectator.
The efforts made in this direction have received a
warm response from the cadet body, so that during
recreation hours the Plain presents a busy scene
of cadet activities. The green parade ground is
dotted with the golfers in gray shirts and white
trousers; the tennis courts are filled with animated
figures; groups of happy cadets ride by on
horseback for a gallop in the woods, while others
prefer the more sedate hiking in the surrounding
hills. It is a great temptation after the recitations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
and drills to be lazy, hang around one’s
room, or “bone fiction” which means reading
novels, but in recent years the men have become
more and more sensible of the many advantages
offered them during their cadet days, and a new
spirit of <i>carpe diem</i> has come over the Corps.</p>

<p>But to return to my subject of physical training
proper. No opportunity is lost to impress upon
each man the practical use to which he will put
his knowledge of physical training when he becomes
an officer. He is urged to prepare himself to the
best of his ability to become a proficient instructor
for the enlisted men whom he will later command.
In this connection, the cadets learn in their
course of Military Hygiene that the object of all
physical training is to develop the human body in
its entirety in order that there shall result a perfect
equilibrium between all its functions. Many
recruits join the Army without the slightest
coördination of their body. Although well formed
they are awkward, clumsy, stoop shouldered,
without ability to make their different members
act in unison with their minds. If an officer
does not know what to do with these men he will
never succeed in getting good work out of them.
His first duty therefore is to develop the recruit’s
body, especially the functions of control, the coördination
between eye and hand, because the
success of line troops is largely dependent upon
physical aptitude. The modern war makes greater
demands than ever upon the soldier’s physique.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
I heard an observer, recently returned from the
European War, state that the infantryman is now
so loaded down with packs, steel helmets, hand
grenades, and rifle that he finds it difficult to
advance faster than a walk. The strain upon
the physique of the infantryman carrying his pack
is greater than upon soldiers of other arms, and
since graduates in time of war will be concerned
largely with the training of infantry, it is of
paramount importance that cadets should understand
the building up and care of the bodies of
their men. A soldier must possess more than the
average muscular strength, endurance, and organic
vigor.</p>

<p>I see before me daily the fine results of the system
of physical training at the Academy. Ungainly
plebes gradually assume a well-rounded
appearance, an erect carriage with head up and an
elastic walk. I sometimes have to rub my eyes
when I behold a cadet whom I once remembered
as an unformed plebe, as loose jointed as a big
Newfoundland puppy, but who now appears before
my astonished vision as a smart soldierly First
Classman. When the cadets have completed
their four years course they have a decided physical
stamp, showing that each one has been trained
by the same system.</p>

<p>At the end of the year in June, when the Post is
thronged with visitors, relatives, and friends of
cadets who are present for the graduation exercises,
an outdoor demonstration of the setting-up
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
exercises is given on the Plain. The precision and
uniformity with which the movements are executed
arouse great interest as eight hundred supple
young bodies respond as one to the sonorous
commands of the instructor perched on a solid
wooden table.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_210" src="images/i_210.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Setting up Drill on the Plain</p></div>

<p>This drill is usually followed by the Outdoor
Meet, the annual athletic event corresponding
to the Indoor Meet. Each class has its best
representatives entered to win a victory in the
dashes, hurdle races, long distance races, hammer
throwing, jumping, and pole vaulting. Back of
the roped lines surge the cadets of the various
classes, cheering themselves hoarse for their own
representatives. Mothers, sisters, sweethearts,
friends, friends’ friends, in the fluffiest and gayest
summer dresses devouringly trail their “Kaydet,”
and give excited and exaggerated opinions
about things of which they are totally ignorant,&mdash;but
bless their hearts! their presence is an
inspiration to the young gods at their Olympian
games.</p>

<p>On the June morning of the Outdoor Meet,
West Point usually offers one of her incomparably
beautiful days as a fitting setting for the display
of her cadets’ physical prowess. And when
the Meet ends, the cadets all feel that one more
year’s progress been made in their physical
development. The First Classmen who on the
morrow will go forth into the Army, leaving the
protecting walls of West Point, reflect with emotion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
and gratitude upon all that West Point’s
training has done to strengthen their bodies to
endure whatever hardships that might arise in
their new lives as officers.

<span class="large">LESSONS FROM MARS</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">In</span> the Area of the South Barracks, directly opposite
the sally-port, is a little brick building
with a clock tower. It is small and insignificant
looking to the ordinary observer, but not so to the
cadet. Here dwell the “Tacs,” the officers of
the Tactical Department, who are charged with the
discipline and purely military instruction of the
Corps. More especially, it is the Headquarters of
the Commandant, his assistants, the cadet Officer
of the Day, the officers of the guard, and the
orderlies. The mail, the precious mail, is assorted
twice daily within its old walls, and its creaky
wooden floor is worn thin by the lively tread of
hurrying cadets feverishly crowding around the
bulletin boards.</p>

<p>In the second-floor room of the Tower is the
Officer in Charge, the monarch of all he surveys.
True, his reign is but twenty-four hours, but he
returns to the throne about once a week. During
his tour he is the Corps monitor. From the
quaint little porch off his room, the “poop deck,”
as the cadets think of it, he coldly and inscrutably
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
regards all formations in the Area. When the
punishment squad is walking tours, the door of
the “poop deck” opens unobtrusively, and for a
moment he stands casting a glance over the
oscillating gray figures, walking their narrow paths
back and forth. As quietly as he comes forth he
fades from view. The “Area Birds” breathe
more freely as he disappears, but soon again he
reappears like an accusing conscience. His presence
hovers over the daily life of the cadets. To them
he is the “O. C.” and source of all information.
His decisions have the sacredness and authority
of the Delphian oracle. If the weather is threatening,
it is he who decides whether raincoats shall
be worn to meals. If visitors arrive during study
hours, his permission must be obtained to speak
with them for half an hour. If knotty problems
of interior administration bother the Officer of
the Day, his advice is immediately sought. He
is amazingly omniscient.</p>

<p>Each day brings a new “O. C.” until the roster
of the Tactical officers has been exhausted,
whereupon the cycle begins anew. There are
various species of “O. C.’s,” and it is astonishing
how the personality of each one will influence the
day of the cadet. There is the cheerful “O. C.”
with a kind manner and a cordial tone in his voice.
Between him and his young charges there seems
to be a bond of mutual confidence and affection.
They feel that his reserve is assumed “By order,”
and that if they only knew him, he would be their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
friend. They feel his human side, his understanding
of their difficulties, and they have no resentment
when he reports them because they know
that in doing so, he feels a sympathetic pang.
When he enters the Mess Hall, his presence is
welcomed, as much as cadets can welcome the
presence of any officer. Somehow the laughter
seems gayer and the day altogether brighter
during his tour. There is no unconscious load
to carry in addition to the actual burdens of the
day. At parade, a little more effort is made
to execute smartly the manual when he gives the
commands.</p>

<p>Then there is the gloomy “O. C.,” the stand-off
kind that looks daggers upon the approach of any
cadet. He appears to circle over the Corps like
some hungry bird ready to pounce any moment
upon his prey. When he has occasion to question
a cadet, a barrier of ice immediately rises between
them and their viewpoints drift miles and miles
apart. He seems to them never to have been a
young man himself, so little of the power of understanding
does he possess. They look him up in
the Army Register and discover that he too was
a cadet not so many years ago, but to believe it
strains their credulity to the breaking point.
When things go wrong, instead of pointing out
the error in a natural manner, there are anger and
resentment in the voice. All of his “skins” seem
flavored with malice. Apparently, he goes out of
his way to be disagreeable, as if to be so was to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
be military. His tour is regarded with dread
especially by the First Classmen detailed that
day for guard.</p>

<p>But the influence of either type of Officer in
Charge is transient. It passeth from day to
day. If the Gloomy One is on duty, there is the
consolation that the Cheerful One will succeed him
like sunshine after rain. It is the Commandant
of Cadets, the chief of all the “Tacs,” who exercises
the great permanent influence over the
Corps. Ever since the creation of his office in
1825, he has been “the Com” to the embryo
officers under him. He prescribes all of their
drills and casts the mold for the discipline of their
bodies and souls. He is the tribunal that grants
or withholds their privileges and that punishes
them for their premeditated or thoughtless misdeeds.
Whereas a few years ago he exercised his
power for the seclusion of his office, at a distance
from the cadets, today he meets and talks with
them daily, ascertains their viewpoint, giving to
his work the new spirit of the personal touch that
has crept into the instruction at West Point. To
be successful in his important work, he must never
look bored. He must take an interest in the
cadets rather than in the Regulations. He must
be human. To gain the admiration of his men
he must be above all efficient, fairly good to look
upon, military in appearance, and well dressed,
and to gain their liking and respect he must be
smart, strict, and impartial. There are two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
faults in an officer that a cadet finds hard to
forgive: lack of neatness and “being wooden.”</p>

<p>In his work, the Commandant is assisted by the
“Tacs,” Infantry, Cavalry, Field, and Coast
Artillery officers. Officers of every branch of the
Service are represented because at West Point,
the duties of all arms are taught. It is with these
officers more than any others that the cadet
comes into the most direct contact.</p>

<p>For purposes of administration, each company is
commanded by a Tactical officer. He passes upon
all permits, requests, requisitions for clothing and
for ordnance. He inspects the rooms of his
command to see that they are clean and in order.
He examines the rifles and equipment for dirt and
rust. He supervises one or more of the drills.
He is really the presiding genius over the company,
in whose welfare he takes unselfish interest.
It is the duty of him and his brother “Tacs” to
uphold the discipline of the Corps, which means
that when a man has to deal with eight hundred
young wills, American nurtured, he must utilize
something stronger than mere words to see that
the eight hundred conform to the set standards
of the institution. His chief weapon to emphasize
to the cadet the importance of the Regulations is
the report or “skin,” which carries with it a certain
number of demerits, and sometimes punishment
tours.</p>

<p>The cadet consequently looks upon the “Tac”
as his arch enemy. One cannot help having a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
little resentment toward a person who is always
present to check up his misdoings, no matter how
just and well deserved the punishment may be.
The feeling is only human and the military atmosphere
rather augments it. It is especially
difficult, I think, for Americans to feel continually
the heavy hand of authority, because each one
of us is so individualistic. Unconsciously, the
cadet cannot get away from the presence of the
“Tac.” Life in barracks seems to revolve around
this individual. From the early morning inspection,
until the evening study period when he
again comes around, knocking sharply on each
door and interrupting the train of thought, his
spectre, if not himself, is haunting the surroundings.
The cadets know that he is just across the
way in the Guard House, and that they will meet
him at drill in the afternoon. He is the important
factor that must be considered in their daily
comings and goings. He is a sort of irritating yoke.</p>

<p>It is not to be wondered at then, that he is the
subject of unlimited discussion, despite regulations
to the contrary, and that every peculiarity of
manner, dress, or speech is noticed and criticized.
His entire personality is usually summed up
in some nickname that comes like an inspiration
and hits the nail upon the head. Occasionally
the name is complimentary, in unconscious recognition
of an innate nobility which marks him
out as of finer clay, but more often it is uncomplimentary
and droll.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span></p>

<p>Nothing pleases a cadet quite so much as to see
a “Tac” do something wooden. They say that
he is gross, which has nothing whatsoever to do
with being fat, but simply means that his mind
is somewhat dense. Immediately the blunder
spreads like wild-fire from lip to lip, growing as it
goes and repeated with a joy that approaches delirium.
There was at one time an officer on duty
whose idiosyncrasies were told and retold. He
furnished many a good story for the delight of the
Corps, and his departure threatened the existence
of <i>The Howitzer</i>, the cadets’ annual publication,
and of the <i>Hundredth Night</i>, the annual play in
which the officers may be satirized. His mind
seemed to work by rule and regulation. One
night when he was making his inspection of barracks,
he came to a room where only one cadet
was studying at the center table. He entered,
looked around, and then inquired:</p>

<p>“Cadet, where is your roommate?”</p>

<p>“In bed, sir!” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Is he asleep?” asked the officer.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir,” answered the cadet.</p>

<p>“Well, find out,” ordered the “Tac.”</p>

<p>The man then turned to his roommate who was
plainly visible in bed, and asked:</p>

<p>“Jim, are you asleep?”</p>

<p>“Yes” sounded off a voice from the depths of
the comforters.</p>

<p>“He says he’s asleep, sir.”</p>

<p>“Very good, cadet,” replied the “Tac,” and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
quite satisfied, left the room, just in time to escape
the outburst of laughter that followed this
highly intellectual conversation.</p>

<p>To be always under the observation of so many
pairs of keen young critical eyes is sufficient to
make any officer somewhat self-conscious, and to
give a certain kink and twist to his actions. The
cadets, like all youth, are merciless in their judgment,
sometimes almost cruel. They are ever on
the alert for any slip that the “Tac” may make
and intolerantly condemn him. But so responsive
are the cadets that it would take but a smile, or a
word or so bordering on intimacy, to remove all
critical feelings and bring about “glad confident
morning.” I wonder sometimes why that so
seldom happens. I suppose it is because we are
all artificial.</p>

<p>Although the Tactical officer is very much
occupied with the interior discipline and economy
of his company, the greater portion of his time is
given over to the military instruction of the cadets.
The purpose of this instruction is to familiarize
the cadet with the duties and needs of a private
in the ranks by practical experience, to impress
upon his character the habit of obedience, and to
train him in the function of command by repeated
exercise.</p>

<p>In order best to accomplish this purpose, the
cadets are organized into two battalions of four
companies each. This is the present organization,
but as soon as the Corps has been increased to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
full strength recently organized by Congress, the
Commandant intends to make a regiment. Although
the Tactical officers command the companies
in the sense that they are the supervisors
of the discipline and administration, the actual
commanding of the companies on the drill ground is
entrusted to the cadets. Selected men perform
all of the duties of the officers and non-commissioned
officers. They are chosen for this
honor on account of their good conduct and
studious habits, and the soldier-like performance of
their duties. They are as strict and conscientious
in upholding the Regulations as are the officers
themselves. As a matter of truth they are more
severe because they seldom take it upon themselves
to put any interpretation upon the motive
underlying the act. A thing is right or it is wrong.
There is no middle line. Whenever any cadet is
on duty, he insists that all under him obey implicitly
his orders, and should any man be so rash
as to disregard his authority, he instantly enters
a report against the offender. It would seem that
such an action would arouse the resentment of his
fellow cadets, but this does not occur, due to the
honor system at West Point. Cadets generally
recognize that their attitude toward their work
must be different from the student at the average
educational institution because their duties are
all in serious preparation for their future careers.</p>

<p>Of course, there are some men who carry their
authority too far when they find themselves in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
command of their fellows. Sometimes they lack
judgment and consequently deserve sympathy;
sometimes there are a few men who deliberately
try to make an impression upon their superiors
at the expense of the men in the ranks. These
men who allow their desire for probable advancement
to lead them astray are quickly sized up by
the Corps, and dubbed “quilloids.” They are
usually disliked and made to feel the displeasure
of their comrades. In nearly every class there
are some of these men who do not see clearly, and
who persist, throughout their whole course, in
placing false values upon trivialities.</p>

<p>Since the cadets are organized into Infantry
battalions, the greatest amount of time is devoted
to the work of this arm. There are many reasons
why this should be so. The Infantry is the largest
branch of the Army, and to it is assigned the
greatest percentage of graduates. Infantry drill
is the basis of all drills and is the best for inculcating
discipline and cohesion among the men.
Besides, the Great War in Europe has proven
that Infantry is still the Queen of Battle, and that
all of the other branches, the Artillery, the Cavalry,
the Engineers, the Aviation Corps are but her
minions. It is the Infantry that decides the fight.</p>

<p>The practical military instruction of the cadets,
although carried on throughout the year, varies
in intensity at different periods. In the depth of
winter it is impossible to drill out of doors. The
Infantry instruction is then suspended, except
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
for the daily class and meal formations. When,
however, March 15th rolls around, the Ides of
March remember, and the snow leaves the ground,
the Corps begins its annual training. Immediately
after the dismissal of the sections from
recitations at four o’clock, the battalions form in
front of barracks for the afternoon drill. Despite
the raw March winds that blow across the Plain,
chilling one to the marrow, the battalion designated
for Infantry drill sets about overcoming
the inequalities of marching, the lack of precision
in the execution of the manual, raggedness of the
movements that have been produced by the long
inactivity of the winter. It is at this period that
the most scrupulous attention must be paid to the
manner of executing the various movements.
Every little dereliction is criticized, every mistake
is corrected, and every movement repeated until
it can be faultlessly performed.</p>

<p>First the companies are drilled alone and then
later assembled for a short battalion drill before
going back to barracks. Up and down the
Plain the companies march, now in column, now
in line. The right guides of each company seem
to be carrying the burden of the drill as with tense
faces they fixedly regard the two points upon which
they are directing the march of the company.
Meanwhile they are measuring their step by a
silent count of “one-two-three-four.” The officers
and file closers are attentive and alert, giving a
word of caution here and one of reprimand there,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
as the line crowds in on the left, or, like an accordion,
opens out on the right. The plebes in the
rear rank are striving to the utmost to keep in step
and on the line, and at the same time carry their
rifles straight and drag in their chins. The detail
and care with which every command must be
executed begins to produce a feeling of monotony,
and stolen glances seek the clock in the tower.
Fifteen more minutes! The hour seems interminable
and the wind more and more disagreeable.
Finally the hands of the clock roll around to five
and the musician appears in the sally-port and
sounds the recall.</p>

<p>The next afternoon the second battalion attends
close order drill and the first takes its place
at extended order. A lighter gayer crowd march
forth to this exercise. Here they will have a
little chance for individual leadership, the command
of a platoon perhaps, or of a squad, or they
will enjoy the comparative freedom and independence
of the skirmisher. In the early part of
the spring course the mechanism of the drill must
be rehearsed upon the Plain. The parade ground
is therefore dotted with prone and kneeling groups
of platoon columns and of squad columns. The
blast of the officer’s whistle, the simultaneous
outstretching of the squad and platoon leaders’
arms as a signal, and the columns magically
deploy into one long line of skirmishers. Once
again the blast of the whistle sounds; more signals;
bayonets are fixed and squads begin their rushes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
forward to the delight of the small boys and
visitors who line the surrounding walks. Then
follows the assembly and the companies do it all
over again.</p>

<p>As soon as the mechanism is well learned, the
battalion is taken up into the hills and maneuvered
over all sorts of ground. Combat problems involving
advance guard and outposts are worked
out under the direction of the Tactical officer.
In these exercises the actual command of the
companies is in the hands of the cadets, but the
Tactical officer, assisted by other officers, directs
the drill. The cadets detailed for this drill called
Field Training are assembled in front of the
old gymnasium where the officer outlines the
problem and gives the men a talk on the principles
that are involved. Each man is made to
understand just what he must do before he starts
out and must know the general principles to be
applied in cases that arise. A situation is assumed
where the cadets are a force in the country
of the enemy. They are to form, we will say, the
advance guard of their regiment. The instructor
gives to the cadets who are to command all information
that he has of his own forces and of
those of the enemy and he points out to the
young commanders what is to be accomplished.
The cadet officers are then called upon to communicate
to the men under them the instructions
that, in their opinion, are necessary to accomplish
the mission. The officer stands near to make
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
suggestions and corrections, or to point out errors
of judgment. As soon as all understand what
they are to do the command moves out to work
out the problem.</p>

<p>It is in the Field Training of the Infantry that
the cadet acquires a real knowledge of command.
He must be able to size up situations and quickly
form a decision. He must then issue orders,
clear and definite, to cover the case. It is in
these drills that he learns something of the art
of handling troops and what is the feeling of responsibility.
The cadets who actually exercise
command are the First Classmen. They are detailed
by roster, irrespective of whether they are
privates or cadet officers, so that every man has
many opportunities to command a company before
he graduates. It is highly important that the cadet
should be given practice in appearing before a
body of men and in giving them instructions.
Nothing helps so much to give him confidence in
himself. It is of great value to him when he joins
his regiment in the Service. Cadets of the First
Class are therefore detailed for every kind of duty.
They are company commanders, acting adjutants,
lieutenants, officers of the day and of the guard.
Whenever there is a chance to place responsibility
upon the cadet, advantage is taken of it by the
Commandant.</p>

<p>The Infantry instruction is progressive. The
First Classmen are trained in more advanced work
by means of tactical walks. These exercises are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
similar to those prescribed for officers in the
Service and are in line with their future work as
subalterns. An officer takes four or five men with
him to some neighboring terrain well adapted to a
particular problem. All of the different phases
of the problem are considered and the cadets
required to size up each situation and issue their
orders as if in actual warfare. They are provided
with maps which they must be able to read with
facility. At the close of the exercise the officer
holds a critique.</p>

<p>Nor is target practice, that important branch
of Infantry instruction, neglected. In summer
when the cadets are in camp, the complete course
of firing as prescribed for Infantry and Cavalry
troops is given the First Class. It is held down
on the flats near the river in the shelter of Cro’s
Nest where a fair range parallels the Hudson.
Every clear morning at seven the detachments
march down to the range. At this hour the
air is cool and crisp and so crystalline that every
feature of the landscape stands out sharply defined.
West Point is incomparably beautiful
at this season and time of the day. But as the
sun mounts higher in the Heavens the coolness
is replaced by a steadily increasing heat. From
the arrival at the range until noon, Washington
Valley echoes with the crack! crack! of the Springfields.
Little groups of cadets are stretched out
in the blazing sun trying to find the bull’s eye and
hoping to pile up a big enough score to win the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
coveted medal of Expert Rifleman or Sharpshooter.
Meanwhile another portion of the men
is down behind the butts, taking its turn in
shifting the targets. All morning long they
monotonously pull the frames up and down,
pasting on the target, now a white paster, now a
black one, or mechanically waving the red flag
back and forth. Intermittently the telephone
rings: “Ting-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling.”</p>

<p>“Re-mark No. 8!” sings out the operator.</p>

<p>Careful search is made on No. 8 for the third
time and up goes the red flag, the sight of which
fills the hopeful cadet back at the firing point
with a feeling of disappointment and disgust.
And so the morning passes, the men firing so
interested that they are oblivious of its flight, and
the men in the butts thinking less of pasters and
red flags than of the cool shower that waits them
in camp, and blessed dinner.</p>

<p>If one wishes, however, to see the finished results
of the discipline and cohesion produced by
Infantry training he must attend either a review
and inspection by the Corps, or a parade.</p>

<p>Every Saturday, shortly after the return of the
cadets from dinner, there is an inspection on the
Plain, preceded by a review, at which the appearance,
clothing, and equipment of the cadet are
minutely examined by his Tactical officer. I
know of no finer sight at West Point than this
ceremony, especially in the summer and early fall
when the Plain is green and the cadets wear the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
excellent combination of the gray coats and white
trousers. As the companies maneuver on the
Plain preparatory to taking their places on the line,
the perfection of their marching, their impeccable
appearance, the white cross-belts, the glittering
breastplates, and bell buttons of coat, the foreign-looking
dress hat with its rigid little pompon,
the splendid bearing of the men, betray the
beholder into believing that he is watching the
evolutions of some legendary <i>corps d’élite</i>. The
scene seems foreign and yet again very American.
The most characteristic feature is the thoroughness
with which every detail of dress, equipment,
and marching has been worked out. When
the Corps turns the bend near Sedgwick monument
and comes swinging down past the reviewing
officer, the most callous spectator could not fail
to have his emotions stirred. His pride is flattered.
He is watching a ceremony whose perfection of
execution and beauty is symbolic of an institution
that in a sense belongs to him, to the man next to
him, and to all the spectators along the line.
It is the product of America. No wonder he reverently
removes his hat as the colors march by.</p>

<p>No less beautiful although not so elaborate is the
ceremony of parade. During the spring and fall,
daily parades are given by the battalion that has
attended infantry drill on that day. The drummers
sound the first call in the sally-port. The
Area of Barracks is practically deserted, but within
the rooms cadets are feverishly adjusting their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
belts, wiping off their guns, struggling into their
coats, or looking for mislaid breastplates. Out
of the doors all at once begin to dart the plebes,
first one then another, and still others. They
hastily proceed to their places on the walk and
mark the rear rank. The hands of the clock
slowly creeping around to the hour for the assembly
are watched intently by the Officer of the Day who
stands in the sally-port ready to give the signal.</p>

<p>From all the doors of the barracks are now
pouring the upper-classmen immaculately dressed
in stiffly starched and evenly creased white trousers,
gleaming white belts, and shining buckles.
Their faces are so obscured by the chin strap of
their high dress hat that all personalities are lost,
and each man appears to be the duplicate of his
fellow. The picturesqueness of the uniforms
and the background of the severe stone barracks
recall the days of Frederick the Great. The
assembly sounds. At once the companies are
formed and inspected. They proceed to their
places in the sally-ports and between the neighboring
buildings preparatory to debouching on
the Plain. At the termination of the Adjutant’s
call the band begins its march. One company
emerges unexpectedly from the north sally-port,
another from the south, another from near the
Academic building, still one more from the shadow
of the old gymnasium. More of them keep coming
and move out on the Plain. The fresh green
grass offers a charming contrast to the white
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
of the uniforms as the companies perform their
evolutions before advancing to the line. The
Plain is dotted with companies in column, companies
in line, companies in columns of platoons,
marching in perfect cadence as if animated by
machinery.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_230" src="images/i_230.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Parade on the Plain</p></div>

<p>The line is now formed stretching from the
flag pole to the trees in front of barracks. A few
minutes of silence reign over the parade while
the Adjutant moves smartly and rapidly to his
place in front of the Battalion, and by command,
brings the Corps to “parade rest.” The golden
sun sinking in the west plays its dying rays on the
long gray line, causing the men in ranks to blink
and blink on account of its brilliancy, and illuminating
the bell buttons of the dress coats until
they sparkle like so many gems. Meanwhile, the
band has marched in front of the Corps and
resumed its place on the right. The retreat
sounds. Then a hush falls over the visitors’ seats
as the spectators rise to do honor to the flag,
while the neighboring hills reverberate with the
strains of the <i>Star Spangled Banner</i>. The exercise
in the manual of arms being terminated, the band
once again crashes forth and the thin gray line of
cadet officers, with their feathered plumes fluttering
and the knots of their red ashes swinging back
and forth, sweeps forward to the officer reviewing
the parade. Smart salutes are exchanged, the cadet
officers face about and return to their companies
to march them in review and back to barracks.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span></p>

<p>Hand in hand with the Infantry instruction
goes that of the Cavalry to which is allotted the
next greatest amount of time in the schedule of
training. Cadets are taught the fundamentals of
every branch of the Service, and all cadets receive
instruction in riding and in Cavalry tactics whether
or not they are destined for that arm. Infantry
officers must know how to ride as well as those of
the mounted branches. Frequently their duties
require them to be mounted, and when they arrive
at the grade of field officer, major, and above,
they are obliged to command their troops from the
back of a horse. It is only during their first year
at the Academy that cadets do not attend cavalry
instruction. When they become Third Classmen
their acquaintance with the horse begins. Cadets
must be taught to ride before they can be advanced
to the tactics of the cavalry, and as a
matter of fact, learning to ride well takes so much
of the allotted time that comparatively little is
left for the cavalry problems. The cadets who
join this branch of the service will learn their
cavalry tactics chiefly in the Army.</p>

<p>Beginning with the Yearlings, therefore, lessons
are given in equitation, outdoors in good weather
and in the magnificent Riding Hall during the
winter. At first life in the Riding Hall is hard for
those men who have never before ridden, but once
they learn the art of “sticking on” they enjoy the
exercise that riding affords. The first few weeks
are particularly trying. When the Yearlings
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
march in upon the spongy tanbark, they find
themselves face to face with a whole row of bareback
horses lined up along one side of the hall.
The animals are champing their bits and wagging
their heads apparently in sheer joy of the anticipation
of “policing” a few victims. Little chills
run up and down the spines of the Yearlings and
their bodies are covered with goose flesh as they
read the challenge in the eyes of the beasts.</p>

<p>“Fall out!” orders the instructor. Ranks are
broken and the men run over to the grinning
horses, scrutinizing them with breathless impatience,
first one, then the other, hoping to
catch a sight of a kind and gentle glance.</p>

<p>“1. Prepare to mount! 2. Moun-n-n-n-t!”
commands the instructor in a sepulchral voice.
Then follow frantic efforts to climb the slippery
hides&mdash;ineffectual jumps succeeded by sudden
descents. Finally they get aboard and all goes
well until the heartless instructor intones:</p>

<p>“Slow trot. March-h-h-h-h-h!”</p>

<p>Such efforts at balancing never before were
seen! One man on a razorback tries every spot
from the mane to the croup in an attempt to find
one little piece of hide whereon he might sit in
peace and quiet; another on an imitation Percheron
wabbles most dangerously and falls off
going around the curve; another is firmly grasping
the mane, or tugging at the iron mouth of some
malicious brute that insists upon holding its head
high, with both ears bent back to enjoy the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
muttered curses of the rider. The galleries are
lined with the daily visitors who smile gleefully
upon the embryo cavalrymen, but the distressed
Yearling’s gaze turns reproachfully toward the
spot where the young girls of the Post may be
seen bunched together and giggling.</p>

<p>As the days pass by the Yearling finds that his
seat becomes more and more secure and by the
time that he has arrived at the dignity of a Second
Classman he feels that he is able to cope with the
wildest of the equine breed. During the first
year the drill was more or less drudgery, but after
twelve months of practice he enjoys the lessons.
He feels the pleasure that comes from the ability
to make one’s muscles obey the will, to feel the
horse yielding to the slightest touch of leg or rein.
The thrill of the leap over the ditch and of the
jump over the wall are sensations that he loves.
Later on when he goes out to the cavalry drill
ground for instruction in tactics, it is the gallop
and the charge <i>en masse</i> that give a new meaning
to the word “drill.” It is no longer a task but a
pleasure.</p>

<p>His progress in handling his horse enables him
to proceed to mounted pistol practice and to
enjoy the privilege of riding on the road, and of
polo. By the time that he has become a First
Classman he is ready to devote his time not so much
to equitation as to real Cavalry instruction. He
learns how to reconnoiter, how to patrol. As in
his Infantry instruction, he must solve problems
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
innumerable: the forming of the advance and
rear guards, the establishing of outposts, making
and breaking camp, the proper conduct of the
march, how to care for his horse the same as though
he were an enlisted man. He must groom him,
feed him, and water him. He is called upon
to perform every duty that is required of enlisted
men in the Cavalry so that when he shall become an
officer, he will know just how much to expect of
his men. He will so understand the fatigue of
grooming, the difficulty of managing some horses,
and the impossibility of always being alert and
attentive that he will be patient and sympathetic,
judging his men by their limited advantages and
not by the standard that he has attained through
a training <i>par excellence</i>.</p>

<p>Portions of the Cavalry instruction are devoted
to hippology and to packing. In hippology the
cadets study a text-book upon which they recite,
but in addition they are frequently taken to the
stables where all types of horses are trotted out
for their inspection and criticism. They must be
able to tell all of the horse’s good and bad points
and must be conversant with the remedies for the
ordinary diseases. The packing is entirely practical.
A pack train is kept at West Point for the
use of the cadets, and they are drilled in putting
up an aparejo and packing the mules. They must
be experts in throwing the diamond hitch.</p>

<p>The branch of the Service, however, that is more
closely allied to the Infantry than the Cavalry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
is the Field Artillery. They are indeed brother
arms. In the fight the Artillery must prepare the
way for the Infantry, using its powerful explosive
shells to demoralize and decimate the enemy
so that the Infantry’s task, hard enough at best,
may be made easier. Among the cadets the Field
Artillery is a popular branch of the training almost
rivaling the Cavalry. The course of instruction
is splendidly progressive. During Fourth-Class
year, the plebes learn all about the instruments,
how to set the sights, to read the scales, the use
of the quadrant, and to perform the duties of
cannoneer. By the time that they go into their
Yearling camp each individual is sufficiently
trained to be a good gunner, so that the class
is ready to receive instruction both in the squad
acting alone, and as part of a battery. During
the fall and drill periods of the Third-Class year,
the Yearlings are called upon to perform the duties
of driver, sometimes wheel driver and again lead
driver. As in the Cavalry instruction, the cadets
must learn all of the duties of enlisted men.
Their experience as drivers will teach them how
hard it is to bring horses and carriage to a stop at a
designated place, how difficult it is to estimate
the ground correctly, and how a man’s patience
can be tried by fractious and unruly beasts.</p>

<p>The members of the Second Class are taught
in the fall the technique of the mountain battery,
and in the spring they act as officers at the drill of
the field battery while the First Classmen who have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
already passed through this stage of the training
are detailed to command the organization. The
First Classmen also spend a great deal of their time
upon the theory of artillery fire, and practice
accumulating firing data. During the First-Class
camp they conduct regular target practice with
the battery.</p>

<p class="author">

<p class="caption">At Target Practice on the Flats</p></div>

<p>The course in Field Artillery has been vastly
improved in recent years. All of the instruction
is given by Field Artillery officers, and non-commissioned
officers who are specialists along certain
lines, instead of as in former days by a stray
Infantry, Cavalry, or Coast Artillery Tactical
officer. All the plebe drill period at that time
seemed to be consumed in jumping up on the caisson
and off again. I always felt like a squirrel in
a cage going round and round without getting
anywhere. Sometimes, too, the instructions that
the officer gave us were a little mixed to say the
least. I remember once an instructor to whom
Field Artillery was an alien art giving us at drill
the following order much to the merriment of the
plebes:</p>

<p>“The cadets will now be divided into three
squads: those that have fired, those that have not
fired, and those that have done neither.”</p>

<p>There are other drills in the cadet’s military
calendar besides those of the three main branches of
the mobile army. No little attention is given to
Practical Military Engineering. In camp one third
of the class spends four hours of the day practicing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
the various methods of signaling, how to make
knots and lashes, how to construct gabions and
fascines, how to use tackle, and how to construct
bridges. The First Class make position and road
sketches, they lay out field fortifications, and dig
trenches. They learn the use of explosives, the
placing of mines, and the dynamiting of trees,
buildings, and railroads. During the Academic
year the Department of Practical Military Engineering
gives the Fourth Class a thorough course
in surveying that embraces both theory and practical
work with the instruments in the field.</p>

<p>The Tactical Department is charged with the
instruction of the Coast Artillery. Several modern
batteries, both rifles and mortars, are installed
at West Point so that the cadets may have every
facility for learning the technique of this arm.
The Yearlings act as gunners, performing the same
duties that are required of privates in the Regular
Army. The Second Classmen act as gun pointers,
range and azimuth setters, do the plotting and
observing, or, in other words, perform the duties
of non-commissioned officers in the Regular Service.
The First Classmen act as battery officers
or as range officers, so that upon graduation they
may join their commands fully acquainted with
their prospective duties.</p>

<p>After the Corps has been given the maximum
of military training for any one year, a week’s
practice march is held as a climax to the intensive
work of the summer camp. With band playing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
and with all the panoply of war the cadets march
down to the ferry to cross to the other side of the
Hudson. For the next six days they march and
maneuver through the beautiful country in the
neighborhood of West Point. Every day camp is
established at a new point and a problem worked
out on the march from one place to the other. All
branches of the Service are represented. The main
body of the Corps go as Infantry, but the First
Class make up the Cavalry and Field Artillery.
The “hike” is a valuable experience for the cadets.
They learn what it means to be a “doughboy”
and carry a pack on one’s back through the sweltering
heat and the dust of the road. They appreciate
how tired the Cavalryman and the Field
Artilleryman are when they throw themselves down
in their pup tents after the labors of the day. Their
understanding of real soldiering is broadened and
their sympathy for the duties that enlisted men
have to perform, awakened. They return to the
Post, footsore and weary, prepared to take up
their studies in barracks and continue their military
training in the limited time after recitations.</p>

<p>During the entire year all military instruction
ceases at six o’clock in the evening. Military
methods are, however, inextricably woven into
every part of the cadet life in addition to what
might be called purely military training. All
during the evening study period, for example, a
certain number of cadets are on guard in the hall
of the divisions to prevent the cadets from visiting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
in each other’s rooms, and to preserve the utmost
silence in the barracks. The only noise that can
be heard is the tread of the sentinel who walks
back and forth wrapped in his own thoughts
that occasionally are interrupted by the Corporal
of the Guard sticking his head in at the door
and saying:</p>

<p>“All right on your post?”</p>

<p>“All right, sir,” answers the sentinel, who as
soon as his superior disappears replunges into his
reverie until time for his relief.</p>

<p>At twenty minutes past nine a preliminary
tapping of the drums is heard on the Plain near the
Commandant’s quarters. A few minutes of silence
ensue. Then the music of the fifes and drums
startles the night as the drum corps commences
its march to barracks to sound tattoo. The
notes of the fifes float out over the darkened Plain
in the weirdest possible manner, as if the spirits
of the night were trying to be gay but could not
suppress a certain plaintiveness in spite of their
joy. They are like a little boy going upstairs in
the dark who keeps saying out loud, “I’m not
afraid, I’m not afraid.” On they come, the
music growing louder and louder, until they reach
the sally-port where their racket is a signal to the
cadets to cease work and make down their beds.
Some of the men are already asleep, but the vast
majority are still sitting at tables, supporting
their heads on their hands as they try to absorb
the meaning of the printed words that dance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
before their eyes. The Drum Corps has ceased
to play and stands near the Guard House waiting
for half-past nine. The silence of the Area
is broken only by the tramp of the third relief
marching around the stoop of barracks from one
division to another.</p>

<p>“No. 1. Off!” commands the Corporal.</p>

<p>The sentinel joins his leader and passes on to
relieve the other sentinels. Meanwhile the hands
of the clock indicate nine-thirty. The “Hell
Cats” sound the tattoo. For the next half-hour
the barracks are animated with cadets running
up and down stairs to the showers, with the noise
of beds being made down and water drawn.
Gradually ten o’clock draws near. The Officer
of the Day standing in the Area turns to the
musicians:</p>

<p>“Sound taps!” he commands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thump! Thump! Thump!</span> goes the drum in
measured beat.</p>

<p>“Li-i-i-i-i-ghts out!” call the subdivision inspectors.
The windows of the barracks seem to
blink for a moment and then darkness envelops
all of the rooms.</p>

<p>And so ends the day that has been continually
under the eyes of the Tactical Department. The
next day will be the same and the next and the
next. Next year, too, the mills of the Gods will
be grinding away bending, twisting, shaping
Mr. Ducrot for his future work. No act of his
is passed unnoticed or unrecorded. Every time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
that he performs a duty the “Tacs” give him a
mark that goes toward determining his standing
in military efficiency and deportment. This is
as it should be because the attitude toward duty
that he displays as a cadet is a good indication of his
future attitude as an officer, and to deny to merit,
talents, and acquirements their just rewards
would be to check the emulation which brings
genius into action and qualifies the industrious
student to become an ornament to his country.</p>

<p>The object of the Tactical Department is to
make the cadets loyal, obedient, and disciplined
young soldiers. It requires them to perform all
of the duties of the enlisted men of the Army as a
method of understanding what an officer can
demand of his men. They can then go to their
regiments with a sympathetic understanding of
the trials and thorns in the path of the men for
whose lives they are responsible. Moreover the
“Tacs” aim to give the cadet a good training in
the fundamental principles of the tactics of each
arm so that he leaves the Academy prepared to
take up the duties of a subaltern. He is not
supposed to leave West Point with the knowledge
of a colonel as some seem to think.</p>

<p>In our present war with Germany, West Point
will continue to send forth her product as heretofore
to help train the immense number of recruits
for the new Army. They will be called upon to
train also the new officers that are needed for the
large force that we will raise, and to this task
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
they must bring not only a practical knowledge
of certain drills, but a mind capable of thinking
straight. They will lend all of the aid that is
possible but they realize also that in training
officers, drill and mechanical maneuvers, however
useful they may be, are subordinate to the more
rare and difficult acquirements that alone can
produce accomplished and scientific officers. What
is chiefly needed in an officer is acuteness of
intellect, either the result of genius or habits of
reasoning on scientific subjects. To this of course
must be added tactical knowledge, the foundation
of which is securely laid at West Point.</p>

<p>In the immense army that will soon be ours, the
graduates of West Point will indeed be a small
leaven, but I am confident they will bring to this
mass of raw soldier material the ideals and the
spirit of their Alma Mater. They will not forget
the lessons learned at her knee, but will justify
to the nation that has given them their education
the soundness of West Point’s methods of training
officers.

<span class="large">HENCE, LOATHED MELANCHOLY!</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">For</span> days and days groups of Army Service
Corps men going around the Post clipping
the trees, mowing the grass on the Plain, and daubing
with black paint the cannon on Trophy Point
have been heralding the approach of June. The
odors of the fresh grass and of the tar in the gutters
are exhilarating smells for every cadet in the
Corps. There are buoyancy and hope in their
manner and a decided note of anticipation in the
air. This feeling of anticipation is the greatest
charm of a cadet’s life. It really begins with the
candidate before he enters the Academy. He
anticipates his entrance; then as a plebe, he looks
forward with even greater pleasure to the day of
his “recognition” when he shall become an upper-classman.
Words are too weak to express the
eagerness with which, as a Yearling, he sees the
spring slip by and June arrive bringing with it his
long desired furlough. And then he has before
his eyes the seeming El Dorado of graduation.</p>

<p>Our plebe, Mr. Ducrot, is especially on the <i>qui
vive</i> for the passage of the days. Ever since the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
snow left the Plain and the surrounding hills, and
the first little blades of grass began to peep through
the boggy spring earth, his attitude toward life
has somehow seemed different. For the past
ten months he has led the life of an obscure being,
like the silk worm in his cocoon spinning his silk.
He has almost completed his work of the plebe
year and is about to emerge from his shell. For a
few weeks he is seized with the languor of spring.
The drills while not irksome seem unduly long; the
lessons harder to prepare. But as the days of May
fly by he feels his wings growing stronger and
stronger and the spring fever is forgotten in the
anticipation of being a Yearling.</p>

<p>At last the first of June arrives! At reveille even,
everyone is happy. He tries his best to answer
about a dozen upper-classmen who ask him all at
once, “Mr. Ducrot, how many days until June?”</p>

<p>“<i>No</i> days until June, sir!” he replies in a voice
that vibrates with joy. It is hard for Mr. Ducrot
to believe that the day that he has so long anticipated
is here. It has been so long coming. He
cannot be mistaken, however, for all around
him are cadets in fresh white trousers, the first
time since the previous summer. He knows
that for years and years it has been the custom
for “the Battalion to go into white” on the first
of June, at reveille. Only a few days now remain
before he will put aside his humility and meekness
and be received by the upper-classmen upon
terms of equality.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span></p>

<p>The great metamorphosis or “recognition,” as
it is called, occurs upon the day before graduation,
immediately after the return of the Battalion
from supper, and just prior to the graduation ball.
On this night, at supper formation and in the
Mess Hall, the upper-classmen are particularly
severe. They “brace” and “crawl” the plebes
more than ever before, filling the air with, “Get
your shoulders back, Mr. Ducrot, more yet! more
yet!” or, “Draw in that chin!” On this night,
however, the whole affair seems humorous, for the
plebes have completed their year and the upper-classmen
are now about to extend to them a
warm handclasp. In order not to let the plebe
training fizzle out or have an inglorious end,
the rigor of the “crawling” that for months has
diminished little by little is all at once revived
with great earnestness and enthusiasm. No one
minds, however, but regards this last evening’s
treatment more as a “grind,” or joke.</p>

<p>After supper the battalions form in front of the
Mess Hall and march back to the barracks in the
soft June twilight. To the observer at a distance,
a roar seems to arise from the ranks as the corporals,
sergeants, and lieutenants hurl corrections at
the plebes. The noise continues until the Corps
wheels into line to listen to the orders of the first
captain standing under the trees in front of the
barracks consulting with the Officer of the Day.
The various instructions and orders having been
announced he commands:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span></p>

<p>“Dismiss your companies!”</p>

<p>At once the upper-classmen in the front ranks
turn and cordially grasp the hands of the plebes
and slap them on the back, the first time in a year
since their arrival at West Point. All of the
dreariness of a year’s subjection is dissipated by
the affectionate and fraternal welcome in the Corps
proper by the upper-classmen, whose strong grips
are to the plebe a sufficient reward for the hardships
of the year just completed. Friendships
whose seeds were sown, but prevented from
growing by the great gulf between upper-classmen
and plebes, now find their fullest opportunity
for development. The Rubicon is
passed, and our plebe lays aside his sackcloth-and-ashes
manner for the more man-of-the-world
one of a Yearling. And richly does he
deserve this recompense for his manliness and
grit! Following Kipling’s advice in <i>If</i>, he has for
a long year (sometimes by <i>force majeure</i>) filled
“the unforgiving minute with sixty seconds’
worth of distance run,” so that his “recognition”
by his fellow cadets means that he is stamped
approved, and that he is entitled to associate
with real men.</p>

<p>Mr. Ducrot is now entitled to enjoy all the
privileges allowed the cadets by regulation and by
the custom of the Corps. As a plebe, tradition
ordains that he shall not attend the hops, or be
allowed the social recreations of the upper-classman,
but now the bars to the pasture of pleasures
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
are removed and he scampers in like a young colt
to enjoy his new freedom.</p>

<p>The two months of camp life that follow graduation
give cadets plenty of opportunities to enjoy
their spare moments. The entire forenoon is
taken up with the various kinds of military instruction,
with infantry drill, practical military
engineering, target practice, artillery drill, equitation,
swimming, and what not, but the afternoon
is at their disposal from the return of the Battalion
from dinner until parade at five-thirty. They
have many diversions from which to choose.
Close by the camp are five tennis courts for the
devotees of the racquet. Upon the Plain is a good
golf course for those who like this sport and speak
its unintelligible language. A selected number of
the First Class defy the afternoon heat playing
polo down on the Flats, while others don their
bathing suits and go canoeing upon the river.
The less energetic throw their blankets in the shade
of the trees near the Y. M. C. A. tent and abandon
themselves to a siesta, or to the delights of some
good book.</p>

<p>Then, there are the social beings who spend
most of their time in the society of girls. They are
the “spoonoids” of the Corps. After dinner they
flock <i>en masse</i> either to the visitors’ seats or to the
hotel where mothers, sisters, sweethearts, friends
and friends’ friends gather around admiringly. It
must not be imagined that all “spoonoids” are
alike. There are the virulent kind who are never
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
in camp during “release from quarters,” who
are never seen on the athletic field except in a
dress coat. They are always rushing some girl,
first one, then another, and are of the genus that
are never quite on time for any formation. They
come running into camp at the last minute, breathless
and excited, and are peevish if everyone
doesn’t turn in and help them into their belts for
parade. Then there is the more moderate “spoonoid,”
the unobtrusive sort, who, when he goes
walking with a girl, dons his comfortable gray
shirt and white trousers, and sets forth carrying
a few deceptive golf sticks. Lastly, there is the
timid kind who sneaks into his dress coat and
tries to slip out of camp without being seen by his
fellows. He really wants to go out but he is a
little ashamed of his desire, and he doesn’t want
the other chaps to know anything about it.
Besides, the chorus of “ahs-s-s-s-s-s!” from all the
tents along the line terrify him.</p>

<p>West Point, however, is indebted to these social
beings for the touch of romance and glamour
that they give to the summer life. Their bright
uniforms and the gay dresses of their partners
(and the still gayer parasols) are seen everywhere
on Flirtation Walk, on the balcony back of Cullum
Hall, on the Plain, and chiefly at the visitors’
seats, and their youth and enthusiasm add a
distinct charm to the social life.</p>

<p>But the real amusements and pleasures of
summer camp come after supper. Thrice weekly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
small hops are held from eight to ten o’clock and
on the other three nights open-air concerts are
given by the band.</p>

<p>The hops are the most popular and enjoyed of all
the pleasures. The Yearlings have an opportunity
of showing how much they profited by their dancing
lessons of the previous summer and they
flock to Cullum Hall in droves. On hop nights
the camp is practically deserted. Some few men
who do not care for dancing, and another small
group who pose as women haters, remain in the
limits visiting one another or reading. The new
plebes, of course, are in their tents, silently working
upon their equipment. Commencing at seven-thirty,
however, a stream of upper-classmen begins
passing the guard tents, signing out for the hop,
bound first for the hotel or for some officers’
quarters where charming young partners await
them. As soon as darkness falls the couples
set forth for the dance. As they emerge out
of the obscurity of the Plain into the brilliant
light that pours out of the main entrance of
the hall they appear for all the world like a
lot of summer insects drawn to a bright electric
bulb.</p>

<p>It is a charming picture that the cadets in their
uniforms and the girls in their pretty dresses make
as they gather in Cullum Hall for the dances.
It recalls all of the stories of beauty and chivalry
that poets have so often idealized. As I watch
them today, their youth tempts my imagination
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
and it runs away, but as a matter of truth the
reality is not quite so ideal.</p>

<p>The cadets, even the most imaginative, see
things more clearly and recognize that some of the
girls that come to the hops were not the subject
of the poet’s thought when he wrote his odes
to beauty. There are all sorts of girls. There are
young girls, and some not so young; pretty girls
and homely ones; vivacious girls and inanimate
ones; intelligent girls and dull ones; and occasionally
some few attend the dances who are so little
favored with feminine charms that for years the
cadets have called them “L. P.’s.” These damsels
are usually the friends of friends, or maybe, the
friends of friends of friends&mdash;very distant as you
see, and the poor cadet is called upon to pay off his
friend’s social debt. He does it well, too, for the
dances are all by card so that every girl has her
partners arranged beforehand, and she leaves the
ball having experienced the intoxication of a great
belle.</p>

<p>The cadets have no little fun over these girls,
and if by any chance they know them ahead of time
they make an attempt to ensnare one of their
classmates, saying:</p>

<p>“Say, Jim, there is a peach of a <i>femme</i> coming
up for the next dance, will you ‘drag’ her for me?”</p>

<p>He elaborates upon her charms with the deceit
of an experienced politician until accommodating
Jim accepts.</p>

<p>Most men, however, are wily about these unknown
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
friends’ friends, but occasionally they are
caught. I know one cadet who was asked to take
such a girl to a hop. He replied that he would
not do so himself but that he would find some
other cadet. With true Irish persuasiveness and
unexampled Blarney he prevailed upon a classmate.
When the latter was making out the card
of the supposedly beautiful girl (but in reality a
true L. P.) his first thought was to offer some
dances to the promoter of the young lady. The
arch-plotter, however, innocently replied:</p>

<p>“I’m awfully sorry, Joe, but my card is full.”</p>

<p>This answer appeared exceedingly strange to
Joe, until he beheld his partner for the dance.
Then the base ingratitude of his friend so enraged
him that he at once broke off all diplomatic and
social relations.</p>

<p>So wary have the cadets become lest they be
taken in, that when a fellow cadet comes out into
the hall to get one of the stags to dance with a girl,
he is at once the object of suspicion. When he
asks his friend to take a dance because the girl’s
partner failed to turn up, or what not, the friend
instantly demands:</p>

<p>“Where is she?” “Where is she?”</p>

<p>Some of the more astute cadets then point out
the prettiest girl in sight saying:</p>

<p>“There she is; she’s a fiend,” meaning she is all
that is to be desired, and lead off their victim
apparently in her direction, but by a well-planned
movement, the victim is shunted off so that before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
he realizes it he finds himself bowing before
Miss L. P. His comrade has escaped in the
crowd, leaving him to “darkness and despair.”
Here begins a desultory conversation, not marked
by any great intellectual effort.</p>

<p>L. P.: “Do you like to dance?”</p>

<p>Cadet: “Yes, do you?”</p>

<p>(Long pause&mdash;atmosphere strained.)</p>

<p>Polite cadet: “Isn’t this a beautiful hall?”</p>

<p>L. P.: “Yes, how many lights are there in the
ceiling?”</p>

<p>Cadet: “340.”</p>

<p>(Second longer pause&mdash;atmosphere at breaking
point.)</p>

<p>Usually a chap relieves the situation by suggesting:</p>

<p>“Let’s go out on the balcony.”</p>

<p>There one can at least console himself with the
beauty of the scene, for unless devoid of all feeling,
no person can behold the glory of the Hudson
from the balcony of Cullum Hall, by night, or
better, by moonlight without being greatly stirred.</p>

<p>Two hundred feet immediately below the
balcony lies the river, apparently calm and unruffled,
but anyone who knows it well visualizes
the deep current beneath that flows resistlessly
toward the sea. On moonlight nights its surface
is agleam from the rays of the full moon standing
almost stock-still over the hills that form the
river’s opposite banks. Here and there as far
down as Anthony’s Nose the obscurity is dotted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
with lights mostly yellow, but with an occasional
red or green that tells of the approach of a boat.
Peace and beauty reign over this scene. It is as
if one were gazing upon the enchanted garden of
a land of fairies. Occasionally the charm and wonder
of the river are added to by the passage of
a night boat that goes churning by, brilliantly
lighted, with its name <i>Berkshire</i> or <i>Trojan</i> outlined
in electric lights, and with its searchlight
flashing broad beams on the banks, first on this
spot, then on the other. The operator plays the
beam upon the Riding Hall, then slowly passes it
to the Administration building, bathing the tower
in light, then to the Officers’ Mess, or maybe some
caprice will seize him and up dances the beam to
the chapel on the hill, descending as captiously to
Cullum Hall. For a few moments the entire
balcony is illuminated by the cold light of the
searchlight that reveals other cadets and their
girls, some seated on the broad granite railing,
and others strolling up and down. The beam
moves slightly upward, and the beauty of Cullum’s
classic lines is outlined against the blackness of
the night. Then a jerky movement of the operator’s
arm and darkness once more enshrouds the
building. The steamer passes on, darting its
beam back and forth like a spoiled child, until it
rounds Gee’s Point where it is lost to view.</p>

<p>The strains of the music draw all of the couples
back to the ball room. A more beautiful hall for
a dance could hardly be imagined. Conceived
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
by the artistic brain of Stanford White, it forms
a most exquisite setting for the gray and white
uniforms of the cadets and the rainbow hues of the
gowns. The fine old portraits of West Point’s
famous generals, the wall bronzes commemorating
their deeds, the battle-torn flags, the Mexican
cannon, the names of the great victories of the
Mexican and Civil wars, are inspiring surroundings
for young men and women. The atmosphere of
the hall impels the cadets to be chivalrous and
courteous. It would be impossible not to have
good manners in such a hall. It is no wonder
that the cadets enjoy the dances and that the girls
find a certain glamour in the entertainments.</p>

<p>On the nights when there are no hops, the
concerts are held, and although lacking the
brilliancy of the dances, they have a delightful
charm of their own. Twice a week the concerts
are given in camp, and once a week in front of
the quarters of the Superintendent. Upon these
occasions the visitors’ seats are crowded, chiefly
with the officers, their families, and guests. Here
and there on the parade ground are groups of
cadets and girls seated on camp stools. The
chaperone sits near by wrapped in a blanket to
protect her from the heavy dew of the evening.
Perhaps, another group will be made more comfortable
by some energetic cadets who spread their
blankets on the ground for seats and arrange
camp stools on their sides for backs. The band is
conspicuously placed on a concrete stand, whose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
brilliant lights cause the iron supports to cast
weird shadows over the listening crowd.</p>

<p>On concert nights the camp is much more
animated than on hop nights. Many cadets do
not go beyond the hedge or frequent the visitors’
seats, but remain in their tents stretched out
lazily upon their blankets, where they “laugh and
joke, and talk and smoke, and turn to boys again.”
Here, clad chiefly in their underclothes, they
comfortably enjoy the music, reveling in the
freedom from the stiff uniform.</p>

<p>Occasionally, to add to their pleasure, a squad
of plebes is summoned and ordered to prepare for
Olympus a delicious “brew.” One upper-classman
who takes the rôle of Zeus directs the plebe
messengers of the gods how to brew the libation.
Having detailed one plebe to perform the duties of
Ganymede, Zeus orders him to get his own G. I.
(galvanized iron) water bucket, clean it thoroughly,
squeeze the lemons, add the sugar and water, and
taste it until pronounced perfect. To give the
brew a proper color and add a little pungency,
a bottle of grape juice is recklessly poured into the
delectable drink. With the strains of the music
floating over the camp and dippers full of “brew”
constantly at one’s elbow, the upper-classmen
reclining at their feast rival the luxury of the
Romans of old. Nor are the “messengers”
forgotten. They are permitted, as a reward
for their services, to drink their fill from the
brimming bucket. Of course, there are a few
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
“eats” too; nothing elaborate, but oh! how good!
saltines, peanut butter, and jam! Words to conjure
with!</p>

<p>Or perhaps, a roving crowd of Yearlings,
restless and filled with adventure, go from company
street to company street, visiting, playing
pranks and jokes, poking their heads into some
plebe’s tent, almost scaring him to death by
yelling:</p>

<p>“Mister, what’s your name.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Ducrot, sir!”</p>

<p>“Who am I?” asks the Yearling.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir!”</p>

<p>“What!!! don’t know who I am? Well, Mr.
Ducrot, you’re pretty ignorant, you get that;
you ‘bone’ me up!”</p>

<p>On goes the gang from one tent to another,
drawn to some parts of the camp by a “brew”
fight, or to another part by the tinkling of some
mandolins and strumming of some guitars. From
the depths of each street strong voices call out to
their comrades in other companies: “Oh-h-h-h-h!
Scott Fulton-n-n!” More often the night is
startled by the frequent call:</p>

<p>“Turn out a plebe!”</p>

<p>Out of the tents bound a dozen plebes to find
out the wishes of the Mighty One.</p>

<p>In the camp there are many sharp contrasts.
Strangest of all is to see some serious-minded
cadet seated in his tent calmly reading, enthralled
by the contents of a book, while all around him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
are disturbing distractions. Neither the fluttering
of the moths and lady bugs around his electric
light, the attentions of the mosquitoes, nor the
laughter and chatter of his comrades, nor the
crashing music of the band seem to draw him
from his imaginary world. Not even the cry of
“Yea! Furlo-o-o-o ...!” so oft repeated by
the Yearlings, makes any impression upon him.
Whenever a Yearling has a little surplus energy
that he must get rid of, he sticks his head out of the
tent and yells:</p>

<p>“Yea! Furlo-o-o-o ...!”</p>

<p>From all parts of the camp, voices echo the call,
and for a few seconds the air vibrates with the
sound of hopeful voices.</p>

<p>After a plebe has been recognized and has
become a Yearling, the one engrossing thought
of his life is his furlough. This furlough, coming
at the end of his second year, is the only vacation
accorded the cadet in the four years, and is anticipated
by him with the keenest yearnings. For
two years he has been living under the severest
discipline and restrictions and separated from the
loved ones at home. The thought of returning
again to the family circle and of picking up all of
the old threads of friendship causes a lively feeling
of joy to fill his manly young heart. It is no
wonder that “Yea! Furlo-o-o-o ...!” finds
a sympathetic response in the hearts of all who
have been cadets.</p>

<p>On Sunday evenings, usually a dull time in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
camp, the regular concerts by the Military Academy
Band are replaced by a concert given by the
cadets themselves. This entertainment is known
as the Color Line concert. A canvas is made of the
plebe class and all of these who admit any musical
talent are ordered to practice. Mandolins, guitars,
violins are all brought out and the whole aggregation,
plebes and upper-classmen, assemble in front
of the hedge. For an hour or more they play and
sing for their comrades and friends, who sit around
on blankets or camp stools, and wave burning
Chinese joss sticks to drive away the tormenting
mosquitoes. The simplicity of the entertainment
gives to these little Color Line concerts an intimate
and charming atmosphere.</p>

<p>As soon as the concert is over the crowd quickly
disperses, the girls going to the hotel or wherever
they happen to be stopping, and the cadets to
their company streets. The quiet of Sunday
evening is then for half an hour broken by the
shouts of the men as they litter up the company
streets trying to assort their clothing for the
Monday wash.</p>

<p>“Turn out a wash list, you plebes!” “Step out,
Mr. Ducrot!” are heard on all sides.</p>

<p>There grows thereupon before one’s eyes small
piles of drawers, undershirts, socks, towels, and
white duck uniforms. Each article is carefully
counted and listed because if the laundry discover
an error on the slip, or find the garment of some
other cadet in the bag, a report is entered against
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
the offender for which he receives a demerit.
Furthermore, the name of each cadet must be
distinctly marked upon each article of clothing.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that any such fortunate
set of circumstances would escape the attention
of the practical jokers among the cadets. Often
the surnames of certain men are identical with the
given names of girls, as for example, Grace,
or Bell(e) or Nelly. Naturally, their garments
are all marked in this way. The jokers surreptitiously
steal an article or two from each of
the above and slip it in the bag of the most Y. M.
C. A. man in the company. The following day
when the delinquency list is read out the Corps
is thrown into gales of laughter by the following
reports:</p>

<p>“Cadet Prude: one pair of drawers in wash
marked ‘Grace’”; or “Cadet Helldodger: one
undershirt in bag marked ‘Nelly.’”</p>

<p>The legitimate amusements of the day are at
an end. Taps comes and plunges the camp into
darkness and all turn in for their much needed
rest. It is then that the practical jokers begin
to think of their nefarious plots. They remain
quiet for some time until the inspections are made
and the company commander has retired after
his half-hour solitary patrol of the company street.
When all the camp is apparently asleep, dark
forms steal forth to their rendezvous and proceed
in a body to the tent of some classmate to “drag”
his cot. Cautiously they approach the tent,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
grab the ends of the cot with the sleeping form, and
quickly drag it to the center of the street. Just
as the occupant of the cot is rudely awakened,
and tries to arise bewildering to defend his rights,
some one of the gang treats him to a cold bath
from a bucket of water provided beforehand. In
the days of hazing this form of amusement was
practiced almost exclusively upon the plebes,
but today the men leave the plebes alone and
devote their attention to their classmates and
friends.</p>

<p>When one is busy and happy the time flies by
rapidly so that before the cadet is aware of its
flight, the summer camp is brought to a close with
a Color Line entertainment. The spare moments
of the Corps are for days beforehand spent in
preparation for this event that marks the end of a
happy summer. The Practical Military Engineering
squad now comes into its own. They build
roller coasters, triumphal arches, small theaters
with cabarets, Japanese gardens, with the greatest
ingenuity and skill. The company streets are
transformed into bits of New York, Tokio, and
Chinatown. Upon the parade is erected a large
open-air dancing platform smothered in the
flags of all nations, where the cadets and their
guests dance away the last evening in camp.
They make the most of their opportunity, for the
next day they must return to the barracks and
commence the Academic term.</p>

<p>Once the studies have been resumed, the time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
for diversion of any sort is limited. The entire
day from 6:00 until 10:00 <small>P.M.</small> is employed with
studies, drills, and necessary personal duties, so
that there is nothing for the cadet but work,
work, work. There are, however, two weekly
breaks in the severe routine. One of these lulls is
on Wednesday afternoon when there are no drills,
an arrangement that gives two hours of leisure
to the cadets.</p>

<p>There are many ways of driving away dull care
during these two hours. The Second and Third
Classmen, who have riding privileges, ride on the
roads around West Point where they enjoy, in the
autumn, a variety of scenes of surpassing beauty.
Clad in their riding clothes, they impatiently
await in the barracks, usually in the lower hall,
the first note of “release from quarters” that
is blown at 3:50 <small>P.M.</small> The moment the bugler
raises his instrument to his lips and sends forth
the first sound of release from quarters the
“ridoids,” except First Classmen, burst from the
hall and race to the stables in order to secure their
favorite mount. Each First Classman has his
mount assigned to him, so that he can be more
leisurely in his movements.</p>

<p>Other men who prefer the society of books
spend all of their leisure at the library where they
seek out a quiet corner and a big leather arm
chair and lose themselves in their surroundings.
They enjoy the atmosphere of calm dignity and
peace that pervades the reading rooms in refreshing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
contrast to the noise of barracks where the men
are constantly running in and out, calling to one
another.</p>

<p>The noise in barracks, however, makes no
impression on the men who spend their leisure
catching up with sleep. An inspection of the
rooms on Wednesday and Saturday afternoons
would disclose many a cadet “pounding joyously
his ear.” Grown weary by the routine, he does
not resist the overpowering feeling of fatigue, but
abandons himself to a delicious slumber.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, numbers of his comrades are out on
the athletic field engaged in tennis, golf, or if not
playing, encouraging by their presence the work
of the football team. The leisure moments of a
large percentage of the cadets are given over in the
fall to practicing football songs and yells. Usually,
some cadet who lacks self-consciousness and who
is popular with his fellows, is selected as cheer
leader. Under his direction the cadets practice
their songs and yells, while the team perfects its
play in front of them on the gridiron. At no
institution of learning does there exist among the
students a greater <i>esprit de corps</i> than among the
cadets. In the fall, all sorts of personal wishes
and inclinations are stifled in order to attend
the cheering practice, and bring it to a high degree
of perfection for the Saturday afternoon games on
the home grounds, and chiefly for the contest
with the Navy. Few of the cadets fail to turn
out for the cheering, because these are accused of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
lacking in spirit, and thereby lose prestige with
their comrades.</p>

<p>Cadets who elect to devote their time to other
forms of athletics, however, are regarded with no
reproach, but men who absent themselves in order
to attend teas or to go “spooning” are looked
upon with some disfavor. Corps spirit ranks
everything in the eyes of the cadet, and he justly
demands that it come first.</p>

<p>Such is the way that cadets spend their two
hours of leisure on Wednesday afternoons. After
the 1:30 <small>P.M.</small> inspection on Saturday the cadets
are also at liberty for the remainder of the day.
They spend their time as described above, the
various diversions changing slightly with the
seasons. Saturday is anticipated with the greatest
pleasure, for in addition to the afternoon leisure,
the evening is free to do as one pleases. How
welcome is the relaxation from incessant study!
There are so many things to do. Some men attend
the hops that are held twice a month; others
dine out at the officers’ quarters; still others go to
the “Movies” which have become a stock entertainment
every Saturday evening in the gymnasium.
Advantage is taken of the freedom to
visit one another’s rooms in the barracks, to laugh,
to talk, to “knock,” possibly to make some
“fudge” on the electric stove that spends the
week days hidden in the recesses of some mattress.
Perhaps one of the men has received some money
from home, unknown to the authorities, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
has treated his comrades to unlimited quantities
of Huyler’s from the Boodlers, or maybe an invitation
has been received to a real “party” after
taps where cold turkey, jams, nuts, sandwiches,
smuggled into quarters, are eaten by an eternally
hungry crowd. After such a feast the condition
of the room can better be imagined than described.
The next morning the occupants make the most
frantic efforts to remove the grease spots from the
floor and table before the Sunday morning inspection.
All of the previous night’s feasters lend a
hand in the scrubbing and polishing; the plebes
are called in to wave towels in the air, or anoint
the furniture with bay rum to drive out all odors
of food that hung over the room from the previous
evening.</p>

<p>The two weekly breaks of Wednesday and
Saturday are increased, however, when the snows
come in November. Drilling out of doors then
becomes impossible so that from 4:00 until 6:00
<small>P.M.</small> daily, the cadets are at liberty. Most of the
men spend these gray afternoon hours in the gymnasium,
or in reading. The Second Class has its
riding class during this period.</p>

<p>After the football season, the diversions of the
winter months are few. The “spoonoids” whose
acquaintance we made in camp recommence their
activities, chiefly visiting the quarters of officers.
The most pernicious ones are called by their
comrades “Tea Hounds” or “Parlor Snakes,”
in a good-natured spirit, of course. The percentage
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
of cadets who meet the officers’ families socially
is small. The men who do most of the visiting
upon the Post are army officers’ sons who have
known some of the instructors at other Posts.</p>

<p>It is regrettable that so many men go through
West Point without having known any of the
officers or their families socially. They meet
the officers only in an official way where the
demands of discipline require formal relations.
This has a tendency to remove the officer too
much from this large number of cadets who lack
the opportunity of knowing informally men with
whom they will later serve. Many cadets in
consequence form altogether erroneous impressions
of their instructors that they carry with
them through their entire service, unless they are
fortunate enough to meet these gentlemen later
on. While at West Point had they conversed
informally for a few minutes only over the dinner
table, or at a dance, this impression would have
been eradicated.</p>

<p>The great gulf that has always separated the
cadet from the officer is, however, yearly becoming
narrower. I have observed lately a different
attitude of the officers toward the cadets. Their
manners are more cordial, more sympathetic,
and more informal. They treat the cadets more
like men instead of schoolboys; their manner is
more that of a superior officer toward a junior.
The result is that the old defensive attitude of
the cadet toward his instructors is gradually
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
disappearing, and he now regards his officers as
instructor coadjutors instead of instructor tyrants.
This spirit is highly beneficial to both officer and
cadet, because the latter, feeling that his instructor
is ready to aid him, becomes very receptive and
consequently calls forth from the former a natural
response unhampered by self-consciousness.</p>

<p>Graduates of the Academy have often expressed
their opinion that the transition from a
cadet to an officer is too abrupt, and have regretted
that before graduation a cadet did not acquire more
the viewpoint of an officer. It is not possible
for a cadet to gain, simply through official contact
with an officer, ideas regarding the service and
little points concerning the command of enlisted
men. Instruction in these matters is provided,
but it must be remembered that time is limited,
and that all recitations, lectures, talks, are in
general marked by formality and a certain degree
of restraint.</p>

<p>In order to make a distinction between the
First Class and the under classes, the authorities
have established a social organization called the
“First Classmen’s Club.” Its object is to segregate
the First Class from the remainder of the Corps,
entrust to it greater powers of command over the
other cadets, and to put into its hands more fully
the discipline of the rest of the Corps. In other
words, its object is to inculcate in its members a
greater feeling of responsibility by giving them
greater powers accompanied by greater privileges.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
The privileges that are accorded thereby make them
feel that they have passed the schoolboy period,
and prepare them to accept properly the greater
privileges of an officer. Although it is called the
“First Classmen’s Club,” it is in no sense a club
as known in civilian life. Nothing to drink, or to
eat, is permitted, nor are there pool or billiard
tables. The Club has a spacious hall over the
north sally-port of the new barracks; it is supplied
with papers, magazines, a phonograph, a piano,
and games such as dominoes and chess, and comfortable
lounging chairs. This meager equipment
may appear ludicrous to the college man who is
accustomed to the comforts and luxuries of his
fraternities, but to the West Pointer who knows
nothing but Spartan simplicity for the past three
years, it means a great deal. The First Classmen
have the privilege of using the Club at all times
during the day, during call to quarters as well as
during release from quarters, but men who are
deficient in their studies are denied its use during
study periods. The affairs of the Club are regulated
by a Board of Governors, of which the first
captain is a member ex-officio.</p>

<p>With the exception of the First Classmen’s
Club the authorities do not permit any social
organizations such as fraternities among the cadets.
In the first place, such bodies are in conflict with
the principles of democracy upon which the
institution was founded and which still characterizes
every act of its administration; and in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
second place, the cadet’s time is otherwise employed
to a greater extent than that of any other
university student in the country. West Pointers
have no time for much else but to study their
profession and develop their bodies. The relaxations
provided for their spare moments are simple,
healthful, and democratic.</p>

<p>There is, however, an organization at West
Point called the Dialectic Society. This body
was originally organized as a literary club in 1824
for purposes of discussing subjects more or less
profound, and of affording members an opportunity
to read their literary efforts. Today, it is an
assembly room open to all upper-classmen who
gather there either to read or chat, or to enjoy
the good fellowship of their comrades. It is also
used as a gathering place whenever the Corps
wishes to deliberate upon some weighty question
that affects their body and that calls for a solution
by a referendum. Its rooms are now over the
east sally-port of the north barracks. Old graduates
will remember its location as the hall over the
north sally-port of the old barracks. The present
room is larger and better adapted for the increased
number of the Corps.</p>

<p>As the fall wears on the principal topic of
conversation wherever the cadets are gathered,
whether in the Dialectic Hall or in the First Classmen’s
Club, is the approaching Christmas leaves.
All thoughts center on the mid-winter vacation,
and efforts are bent to keeping off the delinquency
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
list. Not all cadets get Christmas leave. Those
of the upper classes are granted leaves from
December 23d to 4:00 <small>P.M.</small>, December 31st,
provided that they are not undergoing examinations,
or special punishment, and that their number
of demerits for the preceding year has not been
greater than nine per month in barracks and
twelve per month in camp. There are other
provisos attached, chief of which is the condition
that a cadet must visit relatives or friends. This
regulation prohibits them from going to New York
and staying at the hotels. This restriction works
a great hardship upon cadets from distant States
who have no relatives nearby, or who do not
happen to have made friends in the East; but its
promulgation was found necessary to prevent
the cadets from going to the hotels where they
borrowed money and got into debt.</p>

<p>The tendency at West Point is to be more and
more liberal about granting leaves of absence. I
personally feel that the new policy is the correct
one. The First Classmen especially should have
the privilege of going to New York occasionally
during their last year. Their close restriction
to the Reservation at West Point where everything
is done for them makes them too dependent
and not sufficiently self-reliant. Their appreciation,
however, of the vacation is indeed keen.
No more happy faces could be imagined than
those of the cadets going on leave as they descend
the hill to the station. Not even the woe-begone
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
and dejected attitude of their less fortunate comrades
can detract one bit from the exhilaration
of their spirits. Those left behind, either on
account of studies or conduct, spend their time
tramping in the woods, or skating, bobbing, riding,
reading, or else “boning” for the dread ordeal of
the examination.</p>

<p>The vacation ends on December 31st when the
men on leave return to the Post. That night is
held the New Year’s hop for which the girls in
shoals come to West Point. It has always remained
a mystery to me where these girls come
from. All of a sudden they descend upon the
Post like a swarm of locusts, and the next day as
quickly disappear.</p>

<p>The characteristic feature of the New Year’s
hop occurs at midnight. A few seconds before
twelve o’clock, a musician in the orchestra sounds
the “attention.” An impressive stillness falls over
the ball room, while the trumpeter blows “Taps”
just as the old year dies. Not a person in the
whole room stirs. At the first stroke of twelve,
the trumpeter blows the “Reveille,” a signal that
another year has awakened.</p>

<p>The cadets of the upper classes then rush to the
center of the ball room, form into class groups,
and give their class yell. The under classes yell
for the First Class which politely responds with a
class yell for each. The First Classmen then end
the incident by a yell, adding three prolonged
and joyous cries:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span></p>

<p>“Never again! Never again! Never again!”</p>

<p>They mean that never again as cadets at West
Point will they attend a New Year’s dance. They
are announcing to all present the completion of a
definite period, the closing of one chapter of their
lives that can never again be relived. The music
starts up, the dancers float off, and the incident
is soon forgotten, but to one standing by who
takes the trouble to reflect a little there is an
element of sadness in the almost debonair manner
that these young men renounce a portion of their
lives that has not been lacking in benefits and
in happy associations.</p>

<p>After the mid-winter break nothing interrupts
the routine of the cadets’ ordinary diversions
until the annual play on the 20th of February.
The upper-classmen give the <i>Hundredth Night
Play</i>. It is ordinarily a satire upon conditions at
the Academy. The setting is invariably West
Point, and the principal characters are the officers
on duty. The other characters satirize the type
with which West Point abounds: the cadet girl, her
friend, the chaperone, the cadet “spoonoid,” the
professors and instructors. Shouts of laughter
greet the appearance of the impersonations of the
officers, and rounds of applause follow jokes gotten
off at their expense. There is nothing assumed or
counterfeit about the genuineness of the cadets’
enjoyment. There is, of course, an officer who
censors the play before its production, for although
there is no more polite body of men in the world
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
than the Corps of Cadets, yet their enthusiasm
and eagerness might lead them to indulge in
personalities that would offend. The Tactical
officers who are immediately over the cadets
are most generally impersonated; the exaggeration
of their little weaknesses is not more enjoyed by the
cadets than by the officers themselves. In fact,
whenever any one of them is left out he rather
regrets it.</p>

<p>The approach of spring leaves but little time
for pleasure. Drills are resumed after study hours,
followed by parade and guard mounting, then
more study hours after supper. The Battalions
must be whipped into shape for June week; each
class must be given drills to prepare the individuals
for their coming task in June. Many things
occupy the cadets’ attention. The First Classmen
can think of little else except graduation. They
are busy looking over samples of uniforms, boots,
civilian clothing, or ordering same, or trying on
uniforms. Some few have the added responsibility
of planning for their approaching marriage.
Naturally, the interest of First Classmen in cadet
activities begins to wane. The Second Class
anticipate their First Class camp when the reins
of power pass to them, the Yearlings dream and
dream and dream of furlough. Every spring
evening during the half-hour after supper they
gather upon Battle Monument to sing their furlough
songs. Little snatches float across the
Plain, partly unintelligible, but from which the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
words “love” and “girl” and “moon,” sung with
greater emphasis apparently, can be clearly distinguished.
Only the “call to quarters” drags
them back to earth, whereupon with a vociferous
“Yea! Furlo-o-o-o!” they break up the meeting
and march back to barracks, arm in arm, singing
of the pleasures to come when they will leave the
Academy for two months and return to the bosom
of their families.</p>

<p>Not least of the pleasures at West Point is the
camaraderie. There are always plenty of friends
to be had, fine manly fellows with clean thoughts,
affectionate and kind. A cadet rarely fully
appreciates what this comradeship means until
he is about to graduate. Then he reflects upon
his four years spent in the society of so many
fine men, and he feels a poignant regret at leaving
their midst. The recollections of the hardships
endured and overcome together, of the mutual
confidences, of the sympathy when needed, of
little sacrifices made for him, fill him with tenderness
and sadness. He finds it hard to say good-bye
to the truest friends that he will ever have.</p>

<p>The last few months, however, are so filled
with duties and obligations that he has few moments
for reflection. Before he knows it June
and graduation are upon him. He then attends
his own Graduation Ball. Just prior to the last
dance, once again the First Class assembles in the
center of the room, gives its class yell followed
by the three cries:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span></p>

<p>“Never again! Never again! Never again!”</p>

<p>A little lump comes in his throat as the echo
dies away. Never again will he be a cadet at
West Point. A yell that has heretofore been most
musical has all of a sudden become most melancholy.</p>

<p>Never again!

<span class="large">STRENGTHENING THE MORAL FIBER</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">When</span> a new class of cadets reports at West
Point, it is composed of men as diverse in
appearance, in points of view, and in character
as the parts of the country from which they
come. But after they have been at the Academy
for a couple of years a marked change occurs, and
by the time they are ready to graduate they have
undergone a complete metamorphosis. In some
mysterious manner they seem to have been leveled
to a certain standard, like some scraggly hedge
that has been scrupulously trimmed by its painstaking
guardian. The fat ones have lost their
extra pounds; the thin ones have made good their
deficit; the round-shouldered have straightened
up, and the hollow-chested have filled out. Instead
of a heterogeneous looking lot of men, they give
the impression of having been made from the same
die. And then too there is a uniformity about
their point of view. Whereas at entrance their
whole thought was colored by the life from which
they came and by what they hoped to be, once
enrolled in the Corps, they quickly and involuntarily
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
have found themselves worshiping identical
ideals&mdash;the ideals of Duty, Honor, and Country.
They have discovered at West Point certain
standards that have been approved by other men,
and they have gradually adopted them as their
own. But the real stamp of West Point appears
in their faces. The imprint is evident wherever a
group of the cadets are gathered together, but it
is never so apparent as at the graduation ceremonies
when the cadets individually mount the
platform to receive their diplomas. Then one
can see a certain look in the eye and a certain
feeling of strength about the features that is the
same. It is the look of men who have accomplished
something and of the strength that comes
from character.</p>

<p>What, you ask, is this leveling influence at
the Academy? It comes from discipline, the
discipline of the body, the discipline of the mind,
and the discipline of the soul. It is the one
governing factor in the success of West Point.
All three kinds of it begin on the day that the
cadet reports for duty, and continues without
interruption during his entire course. The discipline
of the body and the mind is a comparatively
simple affair, especially when there is a willingness
on the part of the subject, but the discipline of the
soul is the influence that is hardest to make cadets
appreciate. Some people shy when the word
discipline is mentioned; they think that it means
to break a man’s will and to destroy his individuality,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
but that is not so. The discipline that I speak
of is a process of education whereby a man’s
mental attitude is trained to a certain viewpoint;
whereby his actions unconsciously respond to the
correct ethical view of his duty. It is aimed
to teach respect for law and order, to teach truthfulness
and honesty, loyalty and obedience. It
inculcates respect for superiors, if not for the man,
then for the office that he holds. It teaches a
soldier the sacredness of orders; it is the quality
without which no army is successful.</p>

<p>Under this strong influence of discipline come
men from all sections of our great country and
from all classes of society. Viewed exteriorly
they are, upon reporting, as motley a looking
lot as could be imagined. An examination of
their interiors would reveal natures and characters
of equal variety. Some come from homes
where they have received the most careful moral
nurture; others from environments of vague and
lax standards. Side by side with youths who are
models of truth are lads with uncertain ideas of
right and wrong. Among the throng are brilliant
boys and stupid ones; well-educated lads and
those whose advantages have been of the most
limited sort; sons of rich men and boys who have
known the meaning of want. From everywhere
they come: from the city and from the farm; from
the mountain and from the plain.</p>

<p>It is interesting to dwell for a moment on the
following table showing the sources of the personnel
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
of the cadet body. Herein are listed the occupations
of the parents of the cadets and the
number engaged in each, covering a period of
fifty years.</p>

<p>It is to the sons of men in this list that West
Point applies its discipline in order to create the
type of officer that the Government desires for
its Army. From them must be eliminated the
unfit and the unworthy during the molding process
to which they are subjected.</p>

<p>The immediate effect of the application of discipline
to this variety of material is the creation of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
an ideal democracy. All of the new arrivals are
thrown indiscriminately into the melting pot,
and no attention is paid to any man’s antecedents.
The boys of rich and influential parents are not
allowed little life-preservers of wealth, family, and
position whereby they might remain on top, but
they must boil away, sometimes on top, sometimes
at the bottom of the pot, rubbing and
bumping against boys to whom riches and influence
are strangers. Whether they sink or swim, live
or die, survive or perish, depends on individual
effort alone. Men are esteemed at West Point
for what they are and not for what they have.
Each man feeling that he has as good an opportunity
to succeed as the other man becomes imbued
from the outset of his cadet career with the
spirit of democracy that exists at the Academy.</p>

<p>From the moment that a cadet enters West
Point, his past life, experiences, advantages,
record, disappear into oblivion so far as the authorities
and other cadets are concerned. No reference
is ever made to any cadet’s home, to his connections,
to his family, unless he introduces the subject.
Once he becomes a cadet, a new clean sheet of his
life is started for him, and whatever is entered
thereon depends solely upon himself. Every
man at West Point has the same chance&mdash;the
chance of advancement based upon merit and
efficiency and upon nothing else. It makes no
difference to the officers in charge or to the other
cadets whether a man’s family is wealthy or distinguished.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
As a matter of fact this information
is rarely known because all of the cadets report
together; they are totally unknown to those
in charge so that there is no possible way to ascertain
anything about the cadet’s antecedents.
They lose their identity completely, and so much
so that the upper-classmen take months to learn
their real names, meanwhile calling them by the
generic names, Ducrot, Dumbguard, and Dumbjohn.</p>

<p>The character of the rooms in barracks illustrates
most strikingly this democratic ideal that discipline
fosters. The plain and homely furnishings
of each room are identical in pattern, material, and
quantity, so that no cadet is housed better than
his fellow. The walls are free from pictures, the
windows from curtains, the floors from rugs.
There are no soft easy chairs but only an old-fashioned
wooden one for each man, that is as
hard for the rich cadet as for the poor Mr. Ducrot.
Nor are there any cliques that occupy particular
rooms in the barracks. Each company has so
many rooms for its members, and as far as possible
the men within the company may choose their
roommates. Their selection is made on mutual
attraction and congeniality solely. Whenever
two chaps enjoy each other’s companionship, that
indefinable mingling of mute spirits, they try
to room together.</p>

<p>And then again, the cadets are free from the
distinctions and the social barriers that money
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
creates. They are prohibited from receiving any
money from their homes and are not allowed the
handling of the pay that they receive from the
Government. Instead, the authorities supply all
of their wants, their food, their clothing, their
books, their amusements, so that they might
have no need of cash. In fact there is but one
store on the reservation where they can spend
money, and that is a place called “The Boodlers,”
a sort of a general store at the foot of the hill
near the gas tank. Here they may, if out of debt,
obtain a permit for two dollars per month, and
only those cadets with permits are allowed even
to enter the store.</p>

<p>In this ideal democracy, among the influences
that are considered prejudicial to good order and
military discipline are drinking, gambling, and
cigarette smoking. All alcoholic drinks are consequently
banished from the life of the young embryo
officer, for he must keep a clear brain in order to
think straight and master his problems. He is
permitted only the wholesome beverages of milk,
tea, and coffee that are supplied in the greatest
abundance. Occasionally there is a case of
drinking among the cadet body, but as a vice,
intoxication does not exist at the Military Academy.
One has only to look at the healthy ruddy
complexions of the cadets to be convinced of the
truth of this statement. Any girl might envy
them their skins, whose brilliancy and transparency
would soon disappear if late hours and beer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
were permitted. Nor is there any gambling in the
Corps, unless the betting of one’s ice cream on the
result of some football game be so considered.
The cadets are not even allowed the use of cards
or of any games of chance. They may not indulge
in so harmless a pastime as bridge. Their
chief solace in their free moments must be their
pipes of briar, for cigarettes are frowned upon and
regarded as contraband of war, liable to seizure
by any Tactical officer. The weed is confiscated
and the cadet receives a report. What becomes of
those confiscated cigarettes has always been a
matter of great speculation. Tactical officers
are always under suspicion. I remember one
case where a cadet was caught with three hundred
cigarettes in his possession and told by his officer
to turn them in at the Guardhouse. This order
grieved the cadet very much because he felt that
perhaps someone else would enjoy those cherished
smokes. He therefore bored a hole in each one
with a pin, before complying with his directions.
Soon after turning in the cigarettes, he was reported
for having mutilated them and was made
to walk punishment tours on the Area for many
days. The inference was that some disappointed
Tactical officer could not make the cigarettes
draw.</p>

<p>The ability to maintain a high state of discipline
at West Point is due partially to the wisdom of
placing the instruction of the cadets in the hands
of officers who are themselves graduates of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
Academy. The officers have more prestige with
the cadets and they understand better the preparation
of these young men for their future
duties than could civilian instructors. They
have to a greater degree than most instructors
the prestige of a physical and moral superiority
over their students. They are familiar with the
spirit of the institution and are always on the
alert to guard against corrupt influences. They
better understand how to instill the austere virtues
that a soldier ought to have, and how to form a
brave and virile heart in their young charges.
In a measure they re-create the man and develop
in him the national soul.</p>

<p>The attitude of the cadets themselves, however,
toward their discipline is the real reason for the
success of West Point’s efforts to turn out men who
are high-minded and honorable. They are as
zealous as the officers over them in seeing that
their associates live up to certain standards.
Honor is their shibboleth, and each new man upon
his arrival is instructed in what is meant by Corps
Honor. Upper-classmen give the plebes lectures
wherein they explain the ethics that govern their
body, and leave them no room for doubt regarding
the penalties for an infringement of their code.
From the outset of their careers cadets are taught
the hatred of a lie, and are made to understand
that only by the most scrupulous regard for the
truth, every detail of it, can they be considered
fit to hold their places as cadets and gentlemen.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
Any cadet who is found guilty of making a false
statement regarding even the most trifling circumstance
is dismissed. If he is caught in a
dishonorable act, he is reported by his fellows
to the authorities, or told by his classmates that
his resignation would be favorably received.
In order to do justice to any man accused of
breaking the code, the cadets have among their
body a Vigilance Committee that is composed of
representatives from the three upper classes.
These men investigate all questionable acts that
ordinarily would not come to the eyes of the
authorities, and if they are satisfied that the man
is guilty they report him. For example, at the
written examinations the officers never supervise
the cadets as regards their moral conduct, but
frequently leave the room for long periods. If
any man should take advantage of these circumstances
to cheat, his act, if seen by a comrade,
is at once reported to either the Vigilance Committee
or to the officers. It is apparent therefore
that the honor of the Corps will always remain
unsullied so long as it is left in the hands of the
cadets themselves.</p>

<p class="caption">A Review for the Chief of the Staff of the Army</p></div>

<p>This rigid code of discipline to which the cadet is
subjected for four years and the influence of the
honor system in the Corps develop in him to a
high degree the sentiment of duty. At West
Point duty comes first. The idea is that when a
cadet is given a task to perform he will approach
it with a strength of purpose that never gets weary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
or tired. It teaches him to make his resolve so
strong that he can listen to the murmurings of the
ignorant, to their sophistry, receive their insults
and slanders, conscious that the ideals for which he
stands will eventually triumph. It is the sentiment
that will sustain him not only in time of war,
for then he has the sympathy of the people, but in
time of peace when the average layman who does
not understand the character of his work condemns
it as an activity that produces nothing.</p>

<p>The result of four years’ immersion in the atmosphere
at West Point is the molding of the cadet’s
character. When he entered the Academy he
was just a boy, fresh from the hands of his parents
and still malleable, but when his course has been
completed under the painstaking care of his
foster mother, his standards have been crystallized
and he has developed into a man of courage,
intellect, and honor. And when graduation day
arrives, and West Point hands each man his
diploma, with it she gives her stamp of approval
and acknowledges her willingness to entrust to
his keeping the cherished traditions of the Military
Academy.

<span class="large">SPIRITUAL INFLUENCES</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Cadets</span> love to lay aside the restrictions of
their everyday routine life, put on their
athletic uniforms and most care-free manners, and
wander among the beautiful hills that are all
around West Point. They like to enjoy the
emotions that spring from a close communion
with Nature, both in the winter, when the afternoons
are short and the valleys quickly fill up
with purple lights, and in the summer, when the
country is extravagantly clothed in luxuriant
foliage. If the day of the cadet has been warped
by all sorts of petty annoyances, all that he has
to do is to climb to Redoubt No. 4 or go to Fort
Putnam, and feast his eyes upon a scene of unsurpassing
beauty in order to have his cramped soul
straightened out and to be lifted above his material
surroundings. What greater pleasure does his
life afford than to lie in the warm spring sunshine
of Fort Putnam and drink in the panorama below?
All of the cares of his daily existence drop away
under the spell of a mysterious kind of an influence
that fills his being and stirs his innate nobility.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
He is thankful that he is privileged to live in such
a wonderful and beautiful place. Its effect is
like that of some drug that soothes and calms,
that gives him a kindly feeling toward humanity,
and that makes him glad to be alive. On all
sides he is affected by Nature who has done her
best to develop all of his spirituality and to
awaken his finer sensibilities. Wherever he wanders
or wherever the eye roves, there is a scene
to admire, almost reverentially. No less appealing
than the hills is the river with its many moods.</p>

<p>And there are the buildings whose beauty likewise
exerts a subtle spiritual influence and acts
as a stimulant to the development of the cadet’s
æsthetic tastes. His Barracks, his Recitation
Halls, his Riding Academy, his Gymnasium, his
Mess Hall, and especially his Chapel, built as
they all are from the natural rock of West Point’s
hills, seem to grow right out of their surroundings
as if God planted them there as a part of His
natural design. Their presence is ever a reminder
to the cadet that he has consecrated his life to an
ideal, for on their exteriors are carved in conspicuous
places the shields of his Alma Mater and of his
country, bearing their motto of duty and honor.
The walls of the interiors are hung with the portraits
of famous sons of the Academy, whose
devotion to their country and to an ideal serves
as an inspiration to the cadet and makes him
sensible to the value of moral qualities.</p>

<p>Hovering over both the grounds and the buildings
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
is the influence of the flag. As a cadet sees it
floating from its tall white staff, somehow it has
come to have a different meaning from the days
when he was a care-free civilian. It seems to
him to possess a personality of which he never
before was aware. He feels for it a real reverence,
because he is conscious of being in the presence
of something big, as if beholding the whole power
of a nation. He sees in it the emblem of the
country’s sovereignty and the symbol to which
he has pledged his life’s service. Mingled with
his feeling of reverence is his personal affection.
Day after day he has watched it silhouetted
against the sky and has felt the thrill of patriotism,
when it was being lowered at retreat to the accompaniment
of <i>The Star Spangled Banner</i>.</p>

<p>It is not to the beauty of Nature and to the flag
alone that the cadet must turn for his spiritual
refreshment. The Chaplain, a man with a fine
grip upon the Corps, gathers together in classes
those cadets who desire to come, and explains
to them the word of God. His Bible classes
today are a continuation of the famous classes
that were held at West Point for so many years by
Miss Anna Warner. During the summer encampment,
she taught her boys in the old chapel after
the morning services, where for one hour the
cadets received from her sainted lips an interpretation
of the Scriptures, and were elevated by contact
with her noble character. I can see her before
me now, her quaint silk dress, her small delicate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
body, her ethereal face framed in the neatest and
whitest of curls that peeped from out of her charming
poke bonnet. Her whole presence radiated
goodness and spirituality. Prior to the dismissal
of the class she would regularly present to each
cadet a fragrant little bouquet of flowers that she
had that morning gathered from her modest
garden, and arranged into the daintiest of nosegays.
These few flowers were simple, like the
donor, but they brought into the life of the recipient
a spiritual perfume that awakened his memories
and took him back home to rose-scented gardens
and neat graveled paths where another sainted
woman was praying for the welfare of his soul.
So he took the little nosegay back to camp with
him and put it carefully in his tumblerful of
water alongside of his tent, as a reminder of what
he should be, and as a check on ignoble impulses.
Here and there in his own company streets, he
would see his comrades’ bouquets, little dashes of
color, the red of the petunia, the blue of the cornflower,
the yellow of the marigold, and as they
caught his eye they seemed to be a part of Miss
Warner still exerting her inspiring influence.</p>

<p>It is regrettable that the cadets of the future will
never have the good fortune to know her, for last
year (1916) she passed to her reward after ninety
years in the service of God. Although it is rare
that anyone outside the Academy is buried in the
cemetery at West Point, her body was laid to rest
there, near the bluff that overlooks the Hudson
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
and in sight of her home on Constitution Island
across the river, that a short time before her death
she generously gave to the Government. To
the Corps of Cadets that she loved, she willed a
magnificent original portrait of Washington by
Gilbert Stuart, that now hangs in the library.</p>

<p>Her Bible class still goes on. Every Sunday
when the weather is fair the Chaplain takes
the cadets over to Constitution Island, where,
under the trees that Miss Warner loved so well,
he continues her work. If Miss Warner sees
her “boys” studying the word of God in the
shadow of the old Revolutionary House, hallowed
by her presence, what pleasure she must feel!</p>

<p>If, however, neither the beauties of Nature nor
the interest of the Bible class appeal to the cadet,
he cannot help having his spiritual self stirred
by the impressive service at the Cadet Chapel.
All cadets are required to attend divine service.
The large majority go to the Cadet Chapel because
it is for all denominations, the building never
having been consecrated to any particular faith,
but about ten per cent. of the cadets attend service
at the Catholic Chapel.</p>

<p>The service at the Cadet Chapel is so impressive
and interesting that the majority of the cadets
look forward with pleasure to Sunday morning.
I suppose that all former cadets will smile upon
reading this statement, when they remember the
reluctance with which they donned their dress
coats and belts for the weekly service, at which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
they had difficulty in keeping awake while the
lessons and sermon were being read. But times
have changed since then, due principally to the
atmosphere of the new Chapel and the music of
its splendid organ. Sir Roger de Coverly would
rejoice to behold so model a congregation and
to hear such excellent singing.</p>

<p>The interior of the Chapel is worthy of its
beautiful service. “Storied windows richly dight”
rise majestically to the high Gothic roof and
throw upon the gray walls a myriad of delicate
lights, pale blues and pinks, saffrons, and deep
purples. Two parallel rows of silk flags, the
scarlet of the artillery, the somber blue of the
infantry, and the gold of the cavalry, hang from
the long covered galleries on either side of the
nave. The deep rich shades of the magnificent
memorial window shroud the chancel in a “dim
religious light.” Nor is the service lacking in
military pomp. Company after company of gray-clad
cadets, their brass buttons shining, file
briskly into the Chapel. The tramping of hundreds
of pairs of feet up the aisle and the rattling
of their buttons against the pews as they take their
seats reverberate through the vast hall. The
officers, in their uniforms, and their families
assemble in the seats along the sides.</p>

<p>The first note from the organ announces the
commencement of the service. The choir of over
a hundred voices, singing the processional hymn,
walk two by two in slow and solemn order up the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
aisle to their places in the stalls. A wave of
music sweeps through the church as the procession
moves forward. Last of all comes the Chaplain,
immaculate in fresh linen surplice, and conspicuous
by his distinguished bearing.</p>

<p>The service proceeds. The Chaplain advances
to the reading desk and reads the lessons for the
day. Inspiring hymns are then sung, followed by
an eloquent sermon upon subjects that touch the
daily lives of the cadets. Once again the celebrated
organ peals forth, and during the offertory
casts with its music a spell over the devout
congregation. Two stalwart cadet officers then
march quickly up the aisle to the chancel where
awaits the Chaplain to receive the offerings.
The organ’s music fills the church anew and the
hall resounds to hundreds of strong voices singing
“Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,” followed
immediately by the patriotic hymn,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My Country ’tis of thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet Land of Liberty,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of thee I sing&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Land where our Fathers died,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Land of the Pilgrims’ pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From every mountain side<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Let Freedom ring!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Chaplain standing upon the steps of the
altar pronounces the solemn benediction, which is
scarcely concluded when the choir begins to sing
the “Amen” to the accompaniment of Holy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
Grail motif from <i>Parsifal</i>. Faintly at first the
singing arises from the stalls, then stronger and
stronger, then diminishing in volume until it
dies away with a final “Amen.”</p>

<p>Besides the service at the Chapel there is another
service held on Sundays. It is the Y. M. C. A., a
purely religious body among the cadets and not
as in the cities a sort of club house where a swimming
pool, assembly rooms, and gymnasium are
the main attractions. These advantages are
already a part of West Point’s equipment. The
Y. M. C. A. at the Academy meets every Sunday
evening after supper in a hall over one of the
sally-ports, and here after a few prayers, a speaker
makes a short address. On week days the hall is
frequented by cadets only to read the papers or
to play the victrola, and in Lent the Chaplain
holds afternoon services. Formerly the Chaplain
held these prayers immediately after breakfast,
but once a cadet captain, wishing to remind the
cadets that the services would take place immediately
after the dismissal of the Battalion, mixed up
his verbs and announced very emphatically “cadets
are <i>cautioned</i> about the ten-minute service in the
Y. M. C. A.”! The Sunday service, however, is
the reason for the existence of the organization.
The prayers are not long and the addresses sometimes
most interesting, especially when they relate
to the work that the cadet will have to do as an
officer. The meetings are usually terminated
when the bugler blows the evening call to quarters
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
in the sally-port under the hall. Of all the sounds
at West Point, Sunday evening “call to quarters”
is the most doleful and depressing. It means that
after the break of Saturday and Sunday, the
cadet must once more turn to his books and dig
out the problems for Monday. When he hears
its melancholy, long-drawn-out notes, he has the
Sunday evening feeling, which is only a degree
more cheerful than the blue Monday feeling, and
he reluctantly goes back to his room to begin
anew the weekly cycle.</p>

<p>The cadet is really never quite free from the
spiritual influences of the Academy. Nature,
his Chapel, traditions, precept, and example so
arouse and sharpen his insight into things and into
himself that his day gradually assumes a new
background. These are the influences that, when
he is an officer, draw him back to his Alma Mater
and make him speak of it always with undisguised
affection.

<span class="large">THE SPIRIT OF WEST POINT</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">On</span> a fine bright morning about the middle
of June, every year, the Corps of Cadets
wakes up to find that Battle Monument and vicinity
have been completely transformed. The
Quartermaster’s men have canopied a portion of
the monument’s platform with beautiful brand-new
flags, and placed under them comfortable
wicker chairs for the President, the Secretary of
War, the various generals, and other dignitaries
who usually honor West Point with their presence
on this graduation day. On the front edge of
the platform is a rostrum, flag bedecked, for the
speaker of the occasion, and spread over the green
lawn are rows and rows of seats that await
the coming of the cadets. Promptly at ten
o’clock, the Corps swings across the parade
ground to take its place for the final ceremonies
that mark the separation of another class from
its midst.</p>

<p>This is the day of days in the life of each man of
the graduation class. His four years are at last
completed and he is about to be given the great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
prize for which he has so ardently striven&mdash;a
commission in the Army. As he takes his seat
in front of the platform, he is a little nervous in
spite of the joy at having achieved his ambition.
He realizes that he is about to sever the ties that
have held him fast for the last four years and to
bid farewell to a portion of his life that is finished.
A little tug comes at his heart-strings but it
quickly vanishes as he listens to the eloquent words
of the chief speaker, oftentimes the President,
unfolding to his receptive imagination the duties
and honors that await him in his new life as an
officer. And when the President reminds him of
West Point, of her traditions, of the advantages
that he has been lovingly given, and of what is
expected of him in the Army, there comes to his
eyes a moisture from pride and gratitude. Into his
mind rapidly crowd a thousand and one recollections
of his associations at the Academy. He knows now
that he must leave the Corps behind, that he must
renounce the delightful camaraderie of its members,
and give up the beautiful surroundings
wherein he has grown in body, mind, and soul.</p>

<p>It is true that he can no longer wear the “gray,”
or take away with him his friends, or the buildings,
but he does take away with him something
that is finer than all of these. One can see it in his
face and in his bearing. He goes forth, his heart
armed with the triple brass of Duty, Honor,
Country, and his soul filled with the Spirit of
West Point. All of his nature has been elevated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
and benefited by this indefinable essence. It
forever connects him with hundreds of other men
in all parts of our country and identifies him with
an institution whose very name, <span class="smcap">West Point</span>,
no matter where seen or heard, thrills him with
pleasure. This name connotes the details of the
most impressionable period of his life. Even the
words themselves seem to have a distinction and
personality that no other words possess. They
are flavored with romance and make one think of
something fresh and crisp and clean, something
almost hallowed. They are themselves clothed
with the spirit of the place under whose influence
and power he will forever remain.</p>

<p>He leaves the Academy to join the great fraternity
of West Pointers in the Service, animated by
the same spirit. With them, he is this year (1917)
called upon by the President to train for war a large
army of his fellow citizens, and prepare them to meet
an enemy schooled in the art of war by disciplined
leaders. West Point sends him forth to this task,
rich in knowledge. His Alma Mater is confident
that he will train these men of the new Army in the
fundamentals of their profession and that he will
inspire them with his ideals of courage and of honor,
and imbue them with the Spirit of West Point.</p>

<p class="caption">Graduation&mdash;President Wilson Addressing the Graduating Class<br />
“We’ll bid farewell to Cadet grey and don the Army blue”</p></div>

<p>In the training of the National Army, he will
have all sorts of men under his command, but the
spirit of the Academy will make him patient and
kind with the stupid, lend a hand to the weak,
give a word of cheer to the down-hearted (there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
will be plenty of them), and instill into all the ideal
of duty. The kind of discipline that he himself
received at West Point will be theirs. He will
teach them to bear uncomplainingly their burdens,
to be loyal and obedient, to care for their health,
and to march and to fight with a spirit that knows
not weariness or depression. Then when these
men shall be sufficiently trained, he will go with
them to France, in the wake of the first division
of Regulars led by a gallant West Pointer, Major-General
John J. Pershing. Here he will appreciate
as never before the value of a great moral force
like the spirit of West Point. It will aid him in
overcoming the obstacles in his path and in those
of his men, especially when the heroics of war
and the novelty of being abroad have ceased to
interest them, and they find themselves in the
trenches in No Man’s Land. They will be
drenched by the rain and burnt by the sun; they
will have to endure the vermin, the mud, and the
dust. They will be driven nearly mad by the
shrieking and bursting of the shells, they will see
their comrades killed and wounded, and perhaps
they too will suffer the same fate, but they will
not flinch; because he who leads them will have
given them something of his spirit&mdash;a part of
himself that West Point made. He must be the
prop upon which they may lean, if need be, and
his spirit the reservoir upon which they may draw
for refreshment. And should he be called upon
to pay the supreme sacrifice, he will leave them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
the Spirit of West Point to carry them to victory,
while he goes to join the ghostly assemblage of
his fellow West Pointers, standing bareheaded to
salute him, as he has stood many times in the
presence of the living Corps.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

THE CORPS OF CADETS</h3>

<p>The Act of Congress approved May 4, 1916, provides as
follows:</p>

<p>“That the Corps of Cadets at the United States Military
Academy shall hereafter consist of two for each Congressional
district, two from each Territory, four from the District of
Columbia, two from natives of Porto Rico, four from each State
at large, and eighty from the United States at large, twenty of
whom shall be selected from among the honor graduates of educational
institutions having officers of the Regular Army detailed as
professors of military science and tactics under existing law or
any law hereafter enacted for the detail of officers of the Regular
Army to such institutions, and which institutions are designated
as ’honor schools’ upon the determination of their relative
standing at the last preceding annual inspection regularly made
by the War Department. They shall be appointed by the President
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
and shall, with the exception of the eighty appointed from
the United States at large, be actual residents of the Congressional
or Territorial district, or of the District of Columbia, or of the
island of Porto Rico, or of the States, respectively, from which
they purport to be appointed: <i>Provided</i>, That so much of the
Act of Congress approved March fourth, nineteen hundred and
fifteen (Thirty-eighth Statutes at Large, page eleven hundred
and twenty-eight), as provides for the admission of a successor
to any cadet who shall have finished three years of his course at
the academy be, and the same is hereby, repealed: <i>Provided
further</i>: That the appointment of each member of the present
Corps of Cadets is validated and confirmed.</p>

<p>“Sec. 2. That the President is hereby authorized to appoint
cadets to the United States Military Academy from among enlisted
men in number as nearly equal as practicable of the Regular
Army and the National Guard between the ages of nineteen
and twenty-two years who have served as enlisted men not less
than one year, to be selected under such regulations as the
President may prescribe: <i>Provided</i>, That the total number so
selected shall not exceed one hundred and eighty at any one time.</p>

<p>“Sec. 3. That, under such regulations as the President shall
prescribe, the increase in the number of cadets provided for by
this Act shall be divided into four annual increments, which shall
be as nearly equal as practicable and be equitably distributed
among the sources from which appointments are authorized.”</p>

<p><b>Annual Increments.</b>&mdash;States at large, 21; Congressional districts,
92; Alaska, District of Columbia, Hawaii and Porto Rico, combined,
1 each year to the source longest without an appointment,
and, when the periods are equal, the choice to be by lot; Honor
Schools, 5; Regular Army, 23 in 1916, 22 in 1917, 23 in 1918, and
22 in 1919; National Guard, 22 in 1916, 23 in 1917, 22 in 1918, and
23 in 1919.</p>

<h3>APPOINTMENTS</h3>

<p><b>How Made.</b>&mdash;The appointments from a Congressional district
are made upon the recommendation of the Representative in
Congress from that district, and those from a State at large upon
the recommendations of the Senators of the State. Similarly,
the appointments from a Territory are made upon the recommendation
of the Delegate in Congress. The appointments from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
the District of Columbia are made upon the recommendation of
the Commissioners of the District. Each person appointed must
be an actual resident of the State, District, or Territory from
which the appointment is made.</p>

<p>The appointments from the United States at large are made
by the President of the United States upon his own selection.
The cadets from Porto Rico, who must be natives of that island,
are appointed by the President on the recommendation of the
Resident Commissioner.</p>

<p>The appointments from among the honor graduates of educational
institutions designated as “honor schools” will be made
upon the recommendation of the heads of the respective schools.</p>

<p>The appointments from among the enlisted men of the National
Guard will be made upon the recommendation of the Governors
of the respective States and Territories.</p>

<p>The appointments from among the enlisted men of the regular
army will be made upon the recommendation of the Commanding
Generals of the Territorial Departments.</p>

<p>The Secretary of War is authorized to permit not exceeding
four Filipinos, to be designated, one for each class, by the Governor
General of the Philippine Islands, to receive instruction at
the United States Military Academy at West Point: <i>Provided</i>,
That the Filipinos undergoing instruction, shall receive the same
pay, allowances, and emoluments as are authorized by law for
cadets at the Military Academy appointed from the United States,
to be paid out of the same appropriations: <i>And provided further</i>,
That said Filipinos undergoing instruction on graduation shall be
eligible only to commissions in the Philippine Scouts. And the
provisions of section 1321, Revised Statutes, are modified in
the case of Filipinos undergoing instruction, so as to require
them to engage to serve for eight years, unless sooner discharged,
in the Philippine Scouts.</p>

<p><b>Date of Appointments.</b>&mdash;Appointments are required by law to
be made <i>one year in advance</i> of the date of admission, except in
cases where, by reason of death or other cause, a vacancy occurs
which cannot be provided for by such appointment in advance.
These vacancies are filled in time for the next examination.</p>

<p><b>Candidates.</b>&mdash;For each vacancy from a State at large, or
Congressional or Territorial district, <i>three candidates</i> should be
nominated, one of the candidates to be named as <i>principal</i>, one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
as <i>first alternate</i>, and one as <i>second alternate</i>. The first alternate,
if qualified, will be admitted in the event of failure of the principal;
the second alternate, if qualified, will be admitted in the event
of the failure of the principal and the first alternate.</p>

<p>For vacancies in the cadetships allotted to the honor graduates
of the “honor schools,” <i>one candidate</i> may be nominated each
year before September 1st from each school. In case the total
number of candidates so nominated is not equal to three times
the number of vacancies, the War Department will assign additional
appointments among the schools to complete this total.</p>

<p>For vacancies in the cadetships allotted to the enlisted men of
the National Guard, the candidates will be apportioned as near as
practicable among the States, Districts, and Territories according
to their enlisted strength. With the exception of the candidates
from the District of Columbia, they will be selected by the Governors
from successful competitors in a <i>preliminary examination</i> held
between January 1st and January 15th of each year, such examination
to be of a scope and nature similar to the regular examination
for entrance to the United States Military Academy. The candidates
from the National Guard of the District of Columbia will be
similarly selected by the Commanding General of that organization.</p>

<p>The candidates nominated for the cadetships allotted to the
enlisted men of the regular army shall not exceed three times the
number of existing vacancies and shall be equitably distributed
among the Territorial Departments by the War Department.
If the number of applications in any Department exceed the
share allotted to it by the War Department, the candidates in
such Department will be chosen from the successful competitors
in a <i>preliminary examination</i> held between January 1st and
January 15th, such examination to be of a scope and nature
similar to the regular examination for entrance to the United
States Military Academy.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>Each candidate designated to take the regular examination for
admission to the United States Military Academy will receive
from the War Department a letter of appointment, and he must
appear for examination at the time and place designated therein.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span></p>

<p>Fitness for admission will be determined as prescribed in the
Regulations, United States Military Academy.</p>

<h3>REGULAR EXAMINATION OF CANDIDATES</h3>

<p>Examinations of candidates will be competitive in the following
classes, and will be the regular examination for entrance to the
United States Military Academy:</p>

<p>(1) Candidates from the United States at Large, other than
honor graduates of honor schools.</p>

<p>(2) Candidates from the United States at Large, who are
honor graduates of honor schools.</p>

<p>(3) Candidates from the enlisted men of the National Guard.</p>

<p>(4) Candidates from the enlisted men of the Regular Army.</p>

<p>The Filipino candidates selected for appointment, unless otherwise
notified by the War Department, shall appear for mental and
physical examination on the second Tuesday in January of each
year before a board of Army officers to be convened at such place
in the Philippine Islands as the commanding general of the
Philippine Department may designate.</p>

<p><b>Admission by Examinations.</b>&mdash;On the third Tuesday in March
of each year candidates selected for appointment shall appear
for mental and physical examination before boards of Army
officers to be convened at such places as the War Department
may designate.</p>

<p>Each candidate must show by examination that he is well
versed in algebra, to include quadratic equations and progressions,
and in plane geometry, English grammar, composition and
literature, descriptive and physical geography, and general and
United States history, as explained in the circular of notification.</p>

<p><b>Admission by Certificate.</b>&mdash;The Academic Board will consider
and <i>may accept</i> in lieu of the regular mental examination:</p>

<p>(1) A properly attested certificate (Form I) that the candidate
is a regularly enrolled student in good standing without condition
in a university, college, or technical school accredited by the
United States Military Academy, provided that the entrance
requirements of the course he is pursuing require proficiency
in subjects amounting to not less than 14 units of the list given
below.</p>

<p>If attendance at college extends over a semester, a full record
of academic work at the college, giving subjects taken and grades
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
attained in each, must accompany the certificate; if attendance
at college extends over less than a semester and the candidate
was admitted to college by certificate, a certificate (Form II)
from the preparatory school giving a full record of studies taken
and grades attained must accompany the college certificate. If a
scrutiny of the certificate submitted shows low grades, the
certificate will be rejected.</p>

<p>A certificate indicating enrollment in or admission to an
institution at any other time than that specified in the college
register for regular admission or enrollment will be not
accepted.</p>

<p>(2) A properly attested certificate (Form II) that the candidate
has graduated from a preparatory school or public high
school accredited by the United States Military Academy, provided
that he has in his school work shown proficiency in subjects
amounting to not less than 14 units of the list given below.</p>

<p>If a scrutiny of the certificate submitted shows evidence of low
grades or of graduation at an irregular date, the certificate will
be rejected.</p>

<p>(3) A properly attested certificate (Form III) from the College
Entrance Examination Board that the candidate has shown
proficiency in the examinations set by the board in subjects
amounting to 14 units from the list given below. If a scrutiny
of the certificate submitted shows low grades, the certificate
will be rejected.</p>

<p>The definition of unit and of the ground covered by the designated
subjects is that of the College Entrance Examination Board.
Credits must correspond to the unit values of the respective
subjects. Greater credit than indicated will not be allowed;
less credit will be understood as evidence that the entire subject
has not been completed.</p>

<p>Certificates should be submitted not later than February 15th.
A certificate received between February 15th and the examination
will receive consideration, but in view of the short time left to the
Academic Board to investigate its value, no assurance will be
given that such certificate can be acted on in time to exempt
the candidate from the mental examination.</p>

<p>Candidates who submit certificates on a date which does not
allow the Academic Board sufficient time to investigate its value
and notify them regarding the final action thereon prior to the
day set for the examination, should proceed with the regular
examination.</p>

<p>Candidates who are informed that their certificates have been
accepted must present themselves at the regular time and place
as herein prescribed, for physical examination.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span></p>

<p>A certificate which is accepted as satisfactory for one examination
will be regarded as satisfactory for any other examination
which may be set for entrance with the same class.</p>

<p>Any certificate accepted for one class, and presented for a
succeeding class, should be accompanied with a full statement of
the candidate’s educational work in the interim, and both certificate
and statement will be subject to careful scrutiny by the
Academic Board. (Par. 65, Regs., U. S. M. A.)</p>

<p>All necessary papers, <b>including a set of blank certificate
forms</b>, are furnished to each duly nominated candidate by The
Adjutant General of the Army.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Certificates will be accepted only from candidates
appointed from States at large, Congressional districts, Territories,
and the District of Columbia.</p>

<p>Certificates may be accepted for admission of candidates
from the Regular Army and National Guard in the same
manner as they are accepted for candidates nominated by
Congressmen, except that acceptable certificates entitle the
candidate to appointment only in case the authorized number
of vacancies for that year are not filled by the regular
examination.</p>

<p><b>Date of Admission.</b>&mdash;Candidates who fully conform to the
requirements set forth in the preceding paragraphs, and who
report in person to the Superintendent before 10:30 <small>A.M.</small> the
second day, Sunday excepted, following the date of regular
graduation, shall be admitted as cadets of the United States
Military Academy, and shall receive their warrants as soon as
practicable.</p>

<p><i>Engagement to Serve.</i>&mdash;Immediately after reporting to the
Superintendent for admission and before receiving their warrants
of appointment candidates are required to sign in the presence
of the Superintendent, or of some officer deputed by him, engagements
for service in the following form:</p>

<p>I, &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;, of the State (or Territory) of &mdash;&mdash;, aged &mdash;&mdash; years,
&mdash;&mdash;months, do hereby engage (with consent of my parent or
guardian) that from the date of my admission as a cadet of the
United States Military Academy I will serve in the Army of the
United States for eight years unless sooner discharged by competent
authority.</p>

<p>In the presence of &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span></p>

<p>In the case of the Filipino cadets the engagement shall be made
to serve in the Philippine Scouts. (See Sec. 1321, R. S.)</p>

<p><i>Oath of Allegiance.</i>&mdash;Each cadet shall, previous to his admission
to the academy, take and subscribe an oath or affirmation in the
following form:</p>

<p>I, &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;, do solemnly swear that I will support the Constitution
of the United States and bear true allegiance to the
National Government; that I will maintain and defend the
sovereignty of the United States paramount to any and all
allegiance, sovereignty, or fealty I may owe to any State, county,
or country whatsoever, and that I will at all times obey the legal
orders of my superior officers and the rules and articles governing
the Armies of the United States. (Sec. 1320, R. S.)</p>

<p>Sworn to and subscribed at &mdash;&mdash; this &mdash; day of &mdash;&mdash;, nineteen
hundred and &mdash;, before me.</p>

<p><b>Qualifications.</b>&mdash;No candidate shall be admitted who is under
17 or over 22 years of age or less than 5 feet 4 inches in height
at the age of 17, or 5 feet 5 inches in height at the age of 18 and
upward, or who is deformed or afflicted with any disease or
infirmity which would render him unfit for the military service
or who has, at the time of presenting himself, any disorder
of an infectious or immoral character. Candidates must
be unmarried.</p>

<p>Each candidate must on reporting at West Point present a
certificate showing successful vaccination within one year; or a
certificate of two vaccinations made at least a month apart,
within three months.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Candidates are eligible for admission from the day they
are 17 until the day they become 22 years of age, on which latter
day they are not eligible.</p>

<p>Each candidate designated as principal or alternate for appointment
as cadet at the Military Academy should ascertain as soon
as practicable whether or not he has any physical defect that
would disqualify him for admission to the academy or any that
should be corrected by treatment previous to presenting himself
for examination. For this purpose he should immediately
cause himself to be examined by his family physician, and, if he
desires, also by an Army surgeon at the nearest military post.
Such an examination should enable the candidate to decide
whether to devote the time and possible expense which may be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
necessary for preparation for the entrance examination or to
relinquish his appointment.</p>

<p>The presentation by a candidate of his letter of conditional
appointment, or the presentation by a <i>prospective</i> candidate of
a letter signed by a Member of Congress stating that the bearer is
to be a candidate for cadet appointment and requesting that he
be physically examined, will be sufficient authority for an Army
surgeon at any military post to make the desired physical examination.
Upon completion of this examination, the Army surgeon
will inform the candidate of the result, and, in case a disability
be found, whether such disability is believed to be permanent
and disqualifying for military service or whether it is believed
to be of a temporary or curable nature. The examination is to
be regarded as preliminary only, and in no manner to affect the
decision of the regular medical examining board.</p>

<h3>CHARACTER OF EXAMINATIONS</h3>

<h4>PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</h4>

<p>The physical examination is conducted under the following
instructions prepared by the Surgeon General of the Army:
Candidates who, upon reporting, present evidence that they have
been excused from the mental examination under the provisions
of the certificate privilege, or as the result of having qualified
mentally at a previous examination, are usually examined physically
as soon as possible after reporting and are not required to
wait until the schedule of mental examinations has been completed.
The physical examination of all candidates taking the
mental examination begins on the fourth day and is continued
daily until completed.</p>

<p>Hearing must be normal in both ears.</p>

<p>Vision as determined by the official test types must not fall
below 20/40 in either eye. If below 20/20, it must be correctable
to 20/20 by proper glasses.</p>

<p>In the record of all examinations the acuity of vision without
glasses, and also with glasses when the acuity is less than 20/20,
will be given for each eye separately; in the latter case the correction
will also be noted.</p>

<p>Hyperopia with vision less than 20/20 and myopia or astigmatism,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
either hyperopic or myopic, with vision less than 20/40,
are causes for rejection.</p>

<p>Squint uncorrectable by glasses (not prisms) is a cause for
rejection.</p>

<p>Color blindness, red, green, or violet, is cause for rejection.</p>

<p>The foregoing requirements apply to eyes from disease, either
acute or chronic. All lesions of the fundus, except those due to
simple myopia, lesions not progressive in character, whether old
or of recent origin, are causes for rejection.</p>

<p>A certificate from a competent oculist may be accepted at the
option of the examining board, as evidence of freedom from
lesions of the fundus.</p>

<p><i>Teeth.</i>&mdash;A candidate must have at least 12 of the 20 double
teeth in serviceable condition, so placed that 6 of them are
“opposed” by 6 others. Where not all of the third molars have
erupted and there are none opposed, 8 serviceable double teeth
must be present, so placed that 4 are opposed by 4 others. Where
there are two opposed third molars, the requirements will be
at least 6 double teeth opposed by 6 others. Well crowned
teeth are considered as good teeth. Teeth containing large
cavities or exposed nerves are considered as cause for rejection,
but a candidate with unsound teeth may be accepted subject
to the condition of having cavities filled and teeth put in satisfactory
shape before the date set for his entrance to West Point.</p>

<p>The following are causes of disqualification if found to exist
to such a degree as would immediately or at no very distant
period impair the efficiency of the candidate:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. Feeble constitution; unsound
health from whatever
cause; indications of
former disease, glandular
swellings, or other symptoms
of scrofula.</p>

<p>2. Chronic cutaneous affections,
especially of the
scalp.</p>

<p>3. Severe injuries of the bones
of the head; convulsions.</p>

<p>4. Impaired vision, from
whatever cause; inflammatory
affections of
the eyelids; immobility
or irregularity of the iris;
fistula lachrymalis, etc.</p>

<p>5. Deafness; copious discharge
from the ears.</p>

<p>6. Impediment of speech.</p>

<p>7. Want of due capacity of the
chest, and any other
indication of a liability
to a pulmonic disease.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span></p>

<p>8. Impaired or inadequate
efficiency of one or both
of the superior extremities
on account of fractures,
especially of the
clavicle, contraction of
a joint, deformity, etc.</p>

<p>9. An unusual excurvature or
incurvature of the spine.</p>

<p>10. Hernia.</p>

<p>11. A varicose state of the
veins of the scrotum or
spermatic cord (when
large), hydrocele, hemorrhoids,
fistulas.</p>

<p>12. Impaired or inadequate
efficiency of one or both
of the inferior extremities
on account of varicose
veins, fractures, malformation
(flat feet, etc.),
lameness, contraction, unequal
length, bunions,
overlying or supernumerary
toes, etc.</p>

<p>13. Ulcers or unsound cicatrices
of ulcers likely to
break out afresh.</p></blockquote>

<p>The requirements of the following tables of physical proportions
are <i>minimum for growing youths</i> and are for the guidance of
medical officers in connection with the other data of the examination,
a consideration of all of which should determine the
candidate’s physical eligibility. Mere fulfilment of the requirements
of the standard tables does not determine eligibility,
while on the other hand no departure below the standard should
be allowed unless upon the unanimous recommendation of the
medical examining board for excellent reasons clearly stated in
each case.</p>

<p>The physical requirements should be those of the age at the
birthday nearest the time of the examination. Fractions greater
than one-half inch will be considered as an additional inch of
height, but candidates 17 years old must be at least 64 inches, and
those 18 years and upward at least 65 inches in height.

<h3>PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</h3>

<p>All cadets are examined physically in May of each year, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
those found physically disqualified to continue with the course, or,
in case of the first class, for commission in the Army, are discharged.</p>

<h3>VACATIONS AND LEAVES OF ABSENCE</h3>

<p>Academic duties are suspended from the completion of the June
examinations until the end of August. During this period cadets
live in camp and are engaged in military duties and exercises and
in receiving practical instruction in military and other subjects.
Academic duties are also suspended from December 24th until
January 2d, except for those undergoing examination. All duties
and exercises, as far as practicable, are suspended on New Year’s
Day, February 22d, May 30th, July 4th, Thanksgiving Day, and
Christmas Day.</p>

<p>Cadets of the first, second, and third classes not undergoing
examination are allowed short leaves at Christmas, if their conduct
during the preceding year has been satisfactory. Excepting
these short leaves for good conduct, cadets are allowed but one
leave of absence during the four years’ course. This leave is
granted to those cadets who have successfully completed the
third-class course of study, and extends from the middle of June
to the 28th of August.</p>

<h3>PAY OF CADETS</h3>

<p>The pay of a cadet is $600 per year and one ration per day, or
commutation therefor at 30 cents per day. The total is $746.00
to commence with his admission to the academy. The actual
and necessary traveling expenses of candidates from their homes
to the Military Academy are credited to their accounts <i>after</i> their
admission as cadets.</p>

<p>No cadet is permitted to receive money, or any other supplies,
from his parents, or from any person whomsoever, without the
sanction of the Superintendent. A <i>most rigid</i> observance of this
regulation is urged upon all parents and guardians, as its violation
would make distinctions between cadets which it is the
especial desire to avoid; the pay of a cadet is sufficient for his
support.</p>

<p>Candidates are authorized to bring with them the following
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
articles: Hairbrush, nailbrush, toothbrush, shoebrush, comb, 8
drawers (summer), 12 handkerchiefs (white), 4 nightshirts or
pajamas, 8 socks (black cotton), 6 bath towels, 6 face towels, 1
trunk, 8 undershirts (summer), whisk broom, shaving mug,
winter underwear, and athletic uniforms, shoes, and goods.</p>

<p>Cadets are required to wear the prescribed uniform. All
articles of their uniform are of a designated pattern, and are
sold to cadets at West Point at regulated prices.</p>

<h3>DEPOSIT PRIOR TO ADMISSION</h3>

<p>Immediately after admission candidates must be provided
with an outfit of uniform, etc., the cost of which is about $160.
This sum, or at least $100 thereof, <i>must be deposited with the
treasurer of the academy before the candidate is admitted</i>. It is
best for the candidate to take with him no more money than he
needs for traveling expenses and for his parents to send the
required deposit by draft, payable to the Treasurer, United States
Military Academy. The deposit is credited at once to the
cadet’s account. Upon graduation a cadet who has exercised
proper economy will have sufficient money to his credit with the
treasurer of the academy to purchase his uniform and equipment
as an officer.</p>

<h3>PROMOTION AFTER GRADUATION</h3>

<p>The attention of applicants and candidates is called to the
following provisions of an Act of Congress approved May 17,
1886, to regulate the promotion of graduates of the United States
Military Academy:</p>

<p>That when any cadet of the United States Military Academy
has gone through all its classes and received a regular diploma
from the academic staff, he may be promoted and commissioned
as a second lieutenant in any arm or corps of the Army in which
there may be a vacancy and the duties of which he may have
been judged competent to perform; and in case there shall not
at the time be a vacancy in such arm or corps he may, at the
discretion of the President, be promoted and commissioned in it
as an additional second lieutenant, with the usual pay and
allowances of a second lieutenant, until a vacancy shall happen.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span></p>

<h3>ACADEMIC DUTIES</h3>

<p>There axe two terms of academic instruction: September 1-December
23, and January 2-June 4. A semiannual examination
is held December 26-31, and an annual examination June 5-12.
At the December examination cadets, who are found to be proficient
in subjects they have completed during the preceding
term are arranged according to merit in each subject. At the
June examination they are similarly arranged and they are also
assigned general standing in the class as determined by their
standings in the various subjects. When a subject of study is
completed during a term an examination concluding the work in
that subject is sometimes held. Cadets deficient in studies at
any examination are discharged from the academy unless for
special reasons the academic board recommends otherwise.
Cadets exceeding at any time the maximum number of demerits
allowed for six months are reported to the academic board as
deficient in conduct.</p>

PHILOSOPHY</h3>

<h4>SECOND CLASS</h4>

<p>The course in natural and experimental philosophy begins
with and continues throughout the third academic year. Mechanics
is studied during the first term. The text used is Gordon’s
<i>Mechanics</i>. Many of the principles are illustrated by apparatus
in the lecture and section rooms, and the students are required
to repeat and explain these experiments. The course aims to be
as complete as possible with the limitation that it can be properly
covered in a term of about 90 to 100 days by students having a
proficient knowledge of the calculus; the treatment is sufficiently
mathematical to furnish a confident basis for advanced work
in the technical staff after graduation.</p>

<p>During the second term about 120 lessons are allotted to this
department. The first half of this time is devoted to the subjects
of sound and light. The authorized textbook is Gordon’s <i>Sound
and Light</i>.</p>

<p>Astronomy is studied in the remainder of the second term. The
text used are Young’s <i>General Astronomy</i> and Michie and Harlow’s
<i>Practical Astronomy</i>. The principal aim of this course, in addition
to its important value in educational development, is to
furnish an ample basis for the establishment of stations in explorations
and surveys.</p>

and descriptive geometry are completed in alternation. The
calculus and least squares finish the course.</p>

<p>The course in algebra covers the entire subject as generally
taught in colleges, but the student is expected to have already
mastered elementary algebra to include the progressions and
the solution of the quadratic equation. The course in elementary
geometry includes the books that relate to the plane and those
that relate to space, but the student is expected to have mastered
the former. Plane and spherical trigonometry includes the
complete solution of the plane and spherical triangles. The
course in analytical geometry includes the discussion of the
general equation of the second degree in the plane and the particular
forms of the equation of the second degree in space.</p>

<p>Descriptive geometry includes the orthographic projections
of the right line, the plane, ruled surfaces and surfaces of revolution,
tangent planes and intersections of surfaces. It also takes
the subjects of shades and shadows, perspective, isometric projections
and spherical projections.</p>

<p>The course in differential and integral calculus covers the
ground of the usual college textbook, including briefly the subject
of ordinary differential equations.</p>

<h3>DEPARTMENT OF CHEMISTRY, MINERALOGY AND
GEOLOGY</h3>

<h4>SECOND CLASS</h4>

<p>This department embraces two branches of physics not included
in its title, namely heat and electricity.</p>

<p>The course begins September 1st of the third academic year and
extends throughout this year; exercises, recitations, laboratory
work or lectures take place on all week days.</p>

<p>Commencing September 1st, general chemistry, alternating with
lessons in heat, occupy the time until the close of the term in
December, recitations or other exercises being had daily.</p>

<p>During this term all members of the class whose progress, as
shown by their recitations, warrants it, are given laboratory
practice in chemistry. This practice begins with chemical manipulations
and proceeds in the usual general order of elementary
laboratory work. The laboratory exercises are one hour and
fifty minutes long. It is generally possible to give all parts of
the class some laboratory experience; the amount of this work,
however, varies with the aptitude of the student from a few hours
to forty-five or fifty hours.</p>

<p>This term closes with an examination upon the essential parts
of the entire course, which all cadets who have not shown a required
proficiency in daily work must take.</p>

<p>In chemistry the course is a descriptive general one, based upon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
a concise statement of the more essential principles of chemistry,
and includes that class of information deemed most important to
non-specialists, together with an accurate and logical treatment
of many useful applications of chemistry.</p>

<p>The course in heat is short, but it is a comprehensive elementary
course intended to embrace what is most applicable to subsequent
work at the academy and what is most useful in general education.</p>

<p>Beginning January 2d the daily exercises alternate between
geology, mineralogy, and electricity. This term also closes with
an examination, covering the essential parts of the subjects
studied during the term, which all cadets who have not shown a
required proficiency in daily work must take.</p>

<p>The course in geology is a brief but scientific presentation of the
essential elements of this branch of science.</p>

<p>The mineralogy is an eminently practical course consisting
of the descriptive study and the practical determination of the
important minerals. The lithological and palæontological part
of geology is accompanied in study by the continued practical
examination of the objects described.</p>

<p>The course in electricity is a brief exposition of the leading
electrical phenomena and their relations to each other. It
includes a study of the general principles of the subject and of the
typical machines, generators, motors and transformers, together
with the more important uses of electricity. The laboratory
exercises give experience with a number of the machines and in
the use of a great variety of apparatus employed in the numerous
forms of electric measurements. In this term the laboratory
work is a part of the electrical course and all cadets enter the
laboratory. All laboratory work is performed under the immediate
supervision of an instructor.</p>

<h3>DEPARTMENT OF PRACTICAL MILITARY ENGINEERING,
MILITARY SIGNALING AND TELEGRAPHY</h3>

<h4>FOURTH, THIRD, AND FIRST CLASSES</h4>

<p><i>Fourth Class.</i>&mdash;This class is given an elementary course in the
theory and practice of surveying, instruction in this subject alternating
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
with mathematics during the last 66 recitation days of the
academic year. From May 1st to June 4th the entire morning
is devoted to practical instruction in the methods of surveying
and in the use and adjustment of instruments. During this
period cadets apply in the field the principles and methods taught
them in their theoretical study of the subject. The course
includes instruction in the use of chains and tapes, in profile and
differential leveling and in earthwork computations, in the use of
compass, plane table, transit and stadia with special reference
to the employment of these instruments in military topographic
surveying. The slide rule used to facilitate the work of computation,
and the principles upon which it is based are discussed during
the theoretical course.</p>

<p><i>Third Class.</i>&mdash;During the period of the summer encampment
the cadets of this class receive practical instruction in military
field engineering and military signaling. The course in field
engineering comprises knots and lashings, rowing, construction
of floating bridges with wooden pontoons, canvas pontoons and
rafts, and instruction in military camp expedients. The course
in signaling is limited to visual means only, including the flag,
the heliograph, and the acetylene lantern. The International
Morse Code is applied in the transmission of short messages both
plain and cypher.</p>

<p>Simple exercises in topographic and hydrographic surveying
are also given.</p>

<p><i>First Class.</i>&mdash;During the summer months cadets of the first
class are instructed in military reconnaissance and map making.
This work follows close upon the fundamental instruction in the
same subject given in the Department of Drawing, extends the
instruction in sketching to include road and position sketching,
mounted and on foot, individual and combined. Demonstrations
and limited instruction are given in the various processes of map
reproduction.</p>

<p>In the fall instruction is given in all classes of improvised bridges
and stream crossing, the use of cordage and tackle, erection of
derricks, flagpoles, etc., and the use of explosives in military
demolitions.</p>

<p>The spring course is on field fortification work including the
principles of locating, tracing, and profiling field works, the construction
of trenches, revetments, obstacles, head cover, splinter
and bomb proofs. This instruction is arranged in a progressive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
series of exercises, resulting finally in the construction of a section
of a simple infantry redoubt.</p>

<p>Military signaling is taught this class in both the fall and spring
periods; the work covers the construction and operation of field-wire
and buzzer lines and the radio-communication equipment.</p>

<h3>DEPARTMENT OF ORDNANCE AND GUNNERY</h3>

<h4>FIRST CLASS</h4>

<p>The subject of ordnance and gunnery is studied by the cadets
of the first class throughout the academic year.</p>

<p>The course of instruction covers the principles involved in the
construction and use of war material. It is broadly divided
into three parts: the theoretical, the descriptive, and the practical.
The theoretical part includes the study of the action of explosives,
the study of interior and exterior ballistics, the theories of gun
and carriage construction, and the principles of gunnery. The
theoretical part of the course is not the same for all cadets, those
showing the necessary proficiency taking a special course in the
time devoted by the remainder of the class to review work.</p>

<p>The descriptive part of the course covers the processes of
manufacture of powders, guns, projectiles, and armor; and describes
the small arms, cannon, machine and rapid-fire guns in
use in the United States service, with the carriages, ammunition
and accessory appliances required for their service. The
department is well supplied with models, which are used in conjunction
with the text.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span></p>

<p>The practical part of the course covers the operation of machines
and appliances used in the fabrication of modern ordnance, the
latter work being in effect a short but valuable course in manual
training.</p>

<p>In connection with the course, visits are made to Watervliet
Arsenal, where the process of gun construction is observed, and to
the Ordnance Proving Ground at Sandy Hook, where actual
firings from the several classes of guns are observed, including
usually one or more shots against armor, and where the latest
developments in war material are seen.</p>

<h3>DEPARTMENT OF MILITARY HYGIENE</h3>

<h4>THIRD CLASS</h4>

<p>The course in military hygiene begins with the second academic
year and consists of 13 recitations and 6 demonstrations.</p>

<p>The textbook used is Keefer’s <i>Military Hygiene</i>; the instruction
covers the essentials in the care of troops from the point of view
of the line officer, particular attention being given to personal
hygiene, transmissible diseases, post and camp sanitation, clothing,
and the effects of alcohol and other narcotics.</p>

<p>Practical demonstration in the field is given of the methods of
construction and operation of the various camp sanitary
appliances such as latrines, water sterilizers, incinerators, etc.</p>

<p>Instruction in first-aid is given to cadets in small groups by
practical demonstrations in the treatment of wounds, hemorrhage,
fractures, drowning, poisoning, and other emergencies.

<h3>DEPARTMENT OF ENGLISH AND HISTORY</h3>

<h4>FOURTH CLASS</h4>

<p>The course in English and History begins with the fourth class
in September and continues throughout the academic year, the
whole class attending daily except Saturday. The class is divided
into two parts, which alternate in reciting English and History.</p>

<p>In English, the course of instruction is planned to inculcate the
essential principles of rhetoric, both by study of the textbook and
by frequent practice in the various forms of composition (including
practice in personal and official correspondence), to create an
intelligent appreciation of the best in English Literature by the
study of selected literary masterpieces, and to impart a knowledge
of the important facts in the history of English literature and
language by the study of a textbook and by lectures.</p>

<p>In History, the course of instruction is planned to acquaint
the student with the political, social, and economic history of
Europe from the beginning of the French Revolution to the
present day, to make him familiar with the fundamental
principles of civil government, with special reference to the
United States, and to give him knowledge of various typical forms
of modern national and municipal governments.</p>

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
